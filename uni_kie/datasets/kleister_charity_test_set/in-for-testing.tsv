This success was very\npublicly recognised by the team from the Independent Schools Inspectorate {ISI) which inspected the Schools in March\n2016. Its Report highlighted the very many excellent areas of the Schools' activities and particularly concluded for\nHampton School: 'The quality ofthe pupils' achievements in academic and eo-curricular areas is exceptional"". lt went\non to declare that the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, together with the quality of\ngovernance, is excellent. Such external recognition of the effectiveness of our approach is welcome but unsurprising\nin the light of the extraordinary range of talent and dedication exhibited by staff and pupils alike, driving the many\nactivities and results described in the Governors' Report below.\nA significant development for the Hampton School Trust, as signalled in my Report last year, has been the\nestablishment of the Fitzwygram Foundation, incorporated in March 2016 . This associated charity has been set up\nwith the primary object of providing grant funding for the provision of bursaries to pupils and prospective pupils of the\nSchools. While the Foundation has not yet started fundraising, the Trust has nonetheless once more increased the\nvalue of bursaries awarded over the last year. The Fitzwygram Foundation is being developed in conjunction with an\never widening community of Hampton alumni who are keen to support the School in a variety of different ways.\nConcurrently the Hampton School community has been busy contributing to the Hampton Independent-State Schools\nPartnership {ISSP), a link between two independent schools {Hampton School and lady Eleanor Holies [LEH]) and five\nmaintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames . The Hampton ISSP\nexists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools, and in doing so provides educational opportunities to\nthose from state-funded member schools which would not otherwise have been available to them. lt has led to the\nsharing of many of Hampton School's facilities, including its sports infrastructure and The Hammond Theatre, all of\nwhich are also used regularly by both the local and wider communities.\nThe Trust's premises have been considerably enhanced by the completion, at the end of February 2016, of our\nmagnificent new Prep School building. The opening coincided with a change of name, from Den mead to Hampton Pre-\nPrep and Prep School, representing an exciting new phase in the life of the School and reflecting the closely\ncollaborative relationship with Hampton itself.\nAcademic results were again very impressive, with 91% of the grades awarded as A*-Bat A Level. Of the 66 boys\nsitting the physics Pre-U exam, no fewer than 60 achieved the equivalent of an A* (02) or above (01) . Almost all\nmembers of the Upper Sixth secured places at an elite university and 19 Oxbridge places were confirmed for 2016\nleavers . At GCSE the School achieved another excellent set of results: 91% of the grades were A*-A, with a 99.83% A*-\nC pass rate.\nThe continuing success of Hampton's pupils in their many sporting activities is not limited to their playing for the\nSchool. Four of our cricketers were selected for national programmes and five were awarded outside club or County\ncolours. In football seven boys were selected to represent ISFA nationally and five for ISFA London. Three of our\nrowers won international colours for Great Britain, and twenty nine Hampton rugby players were selected for\ndevelopment groups or pathways with a range of major national clubs. A further two were awarded International\nColours (USA) and one signed a professional Rugby Sevens contract.\nWithin an extensive programme of performing arts over the year highlights included the musicai""Mack and M abel"" in\nconjunction with lady Eleanor Holies and the School Jazz Bands giving three concerts in Malta in July. Hampton's male\nvoice choir ""Voices of lions"" reached the national selection stage at The Choir of the Year 2016 competition; they gave\neight concerts at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nFinally I can once again conclude this Chairman's Report by noting that the finances of the Hampton School Trust\nremain extremely robust. As in previous years we have produced a modest surplus to be re-invested back into ongoing\nimprovement of the School infrastructures. In spite of it being a time of some political and financial uncertainty our\nSchools are full and our lists of applicants continue to grow. lt is not however a time for complacency. As Governors\nwe continue our dedication both to providing the best possible education for our pupils and to developing the means to\nincrease the access to the School for capable pupils whose financial circumstances would otherwise preclude them.\n1\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nHampton School Governors\nThe Governors are the charity trustees and directors of the company and have all served in office throughout the year\nexcept where indicated .\n··-\nDevelopment &\nRemuneration\nHampton Pre-\nPrep & Prep\nGeneral\nFinance\n& Governor\nBursary Fund\nCommittee\nPurposes\nCommittee\nSelection\nCommittee\n~rNJ ~pooner BA\n{Chairman of Governors) j\nIMr SA Bull BSc ACA\n_j\nMrs M Choueiri BA MBA\nI\nIMr RC Davison MA LRPS\n(To22Jun16} I\n[ Mrs M-L Ellis Cert Ed\n~ .,/'\nMr R Kelly\nI Chair\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nHis Honour Judge S E Kramer MA QC (To 9 Dec 15} I\nMr J A Livingston MA DIPL Arch RI BA (To 22 Jun 16}\nMr L R Llewellyn BSc MBA FCMA FRSA MMUS\nMrs R Mercer BA\n{From 9 Dec 15}\nMrAHMundayLLBQC\n.,/ '\nMr S Naidu\n.,/ '\nMrJSPerryBA\n{Vice Chairman)\nChair\nTo22Jun16\nMr A J Roberts CBE BA FRSA FColl\nAir-Vice Marshal G Skinner CBE BSc MSc CEng\nFIMechE FILT FRAeS RAF(Retd)\nMrRM WalkerMA\nMr R J K Washington\n., /'\nFrom 12 Sep 16\nMr L H Welch BArch (Hons) RI BA RIAS\n(From 22 Jun 16}\nThe Reverend D N Winterburn BSc MA\nVicar of St Mary's Church, Hampton (To 12 Oct 16}\nMiss A V Yandle MA (Oxon)\n(From 14 Oct 15}\nHeadmaster:\nBursar, Clerk to the Governors and Company Secretary:\nComm ittee\nCommittee\n., /'\n. ,/'\nChair\n.,/ '\n---------\nI.,/'j\n.,/'\nr-----\n.,/'---1\n. ,/'\n...\nTo9Dec 15\n., /'\nTo22Jun 16\nChair\n. ,/'\n., /'\n., /'\nChair\n. ,/'\n., /'\nFrom 12 Sep 16\n. ,/'\nTo12Sep16\n., /'\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nI\nMr K Knibbs MA (Oxon)\nMrMAKingBSc\nThe Board of Governors of Hampton School is a self-appoi nting body with two exceptions: one is an Ex Officio Governor\nand shall be the Vicar of Ecclesiastical Parish of St Mary, Hampton and one nominated by t he Old Hamptonians'\nAssoci ation, subject to the confirmation of the Governors.\nAddresses:\nWebsites:\nHampton School\nHanworth Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 3HD\nHampton Pre-Prep & Prep School Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School\n41 - 43 Wensleydale Road\nGloucester Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 2LP\nwww.hamptonschool .org.uk\nwww.hamptonprep.org.uk\n2\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 2UQ\n., /'\n., /'\n., /'\n., /'\nChair\n., /'\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nBankers:\nSolicitors:\nAuditors:\nInsurance Brokers:\nInvestment Advisers:\nRegistered\nCharity No:\nRegistered\nCompany No:\nRegistered Address\nBarclays Bank PLC\nCorporate Banking Centre\nOnslow Hall\nThe Little Green\nRichmond upon Thames\nSurrey\nTW91WB\nFarrer & Co\n66 Lincoln's Inn Fields\nLondon\nWC2A3LH\nhaysmacintyre\n26 Red Lion Square\nLondon\nWC1R4AG\nMarsh Brokers Limited\nRockwood House\n1-5 Perrymount Road\nHaywards Heath\nWest Sussex\nRH16 3SV\nGAM London Limited\n12 St James's Place\nLondon\nSWlA lNX\n1120005\n06264434\nHampton School\nHanworth Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW123HD\n3\nVeale Wasbrough\nNarrow Quay House\nNarrow Quay\nBristol\nBS14QA\nOrmerods\n45 Friends Road\nCroydon\nCRO lED\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nThe Governors present their annual report for the year ended 31 August 2016, together with the audited accounts for\nthe year.

CONSTITUTION\nHampton School is a charitable company limited by guarantee. lt incorporates and runs two schools, Hampton School\nand Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School. Both Schools have the same Department for Education number, 318/6071. The\nSchools are governed by the same Governing Body. The accounts of Hampton School Trust are amalgamated with\nthose of the company; following an order made by the Charity Commission on 17 August 2007, under charity number\n1120005.\n2. GOVERNING INSTRUMENT\nThe Company is governed by its Memorandum of Association dated 14 May 2007 and Articles of Association dated 28\nNovember 2007. Governors are also guided by the Scheme of Management and Delegation which includes Terms of\nReference for the sub-committees :\nThe Finance Committee\nThe Development and General Purposes Committee\nThe Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee\nThe Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Committee\nThe Bursary Fund Committee\n3. GOVERNANCE\nThe Governors are required to be members of the Company and are also Trustees and Directors. Governors are\nresponsible for the overall management and control of Hampton School and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School and they\nusually meet at least four times a year. The work of implementing most of their policies is carried out by the members\nof the Development and General Purpose Committee and the Finance Committee which meet before each meeting of\nthe full Governing Board . The Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep and Bursary Fund Committees meet at least three times per\nyear and the Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee once per year. The Governors have continued to pay\nclose attention to their safeguarding obligations and those of the School community in general. The Governors monitor\nthe effectiveness of the Schools' safeguarding policies through the receipt, discussion and review of regular reports\nfrom the Schools' Safeguarding Lead and Officers and the nominated safeguarding Governors. There are currently two\nGovernors so nominated and they are available, whenever required, to advise and assist the Schools' Designated\nSafeguarding Lead and Officers in exercising the Schools' duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and\nyoung people.\nThe Chairs of the sub-committees are appointed at the first meeting every calendar year and the members are listed at\nthe start of this report.\n3.1 Governor Recruitment and Training\nThe Governing Body requires breadth and depth of experience to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently. Where\npossible the composition should comprise the following:\n4\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n•\nA Governor with a legal background\n•\nA Governor with a financial I accounting background\n•\nA Governor with education experience\n•\nA Governor with senior managerial or business experience\n•\nA Governor with experience of equal opportunities and disability needs\n•\nAt least one female Governor and at least one male Governor\nOne Governor may meet one or more of these requirements.\nThe process of appointment is:\n•\nA potential Governor is nominated subject to the criteria laid down by the Remuneration and Governor\nSelection Committee\n•\nDiscussions about the nomination take place with the Chairman of Governors, Headmaster and Clerk to the\nGovernors\n•\nIf a potential Governor is identified as having specific required skills his/her CV is submitted to all Governors for\nprovisional approval\n•\nThe potential Governor usually meets the Governors informally prior to a Governors' meeting and visits the\nSchools and meets senior staff\n•\nSubject to final Governors' approval the Governor is selected\nFollowing appointment, a comprehensive information pack including past Governors' minutes, accounts, the Charitable\nScheme and details of the role of a Trustee is given to the new Governor. The Clerk to the Governors provides regular\ninformation on courses that may be helpful or relevant. Governors are encouraged to visit the Schools on a regular\nbasis.\nNo remuneration is paid to Governors.\n3.2 Organisational Management\nThe Governors determine the general policy of the schools. The day-to-day running of the Schools is delegated to the\nHeadmaster, supported by senior staff. The Headmaster and Bursar are invited to attend Governors' meetings.\nThe Governors' Remuneration & Governor Selection Committee meets annually in the Spring Term to consider the\nremuneration of Hampton School Trust senior staff (key management personnel), taking into account\nrecommendations put forward by the Headmaster. The Committee recommends remuneration levels which are\nratified by the Governors at their meeting at the end of the Spring Term. Once ratified, senior staff remuneration levels\nare communicated to them by the Headmaster and Bursar as appropriate. The Headmaster's remuneration is reviewed\nseparately on an annual basis by the Chairman of the Governors in consultation with the Remuneration & Governor\nSelection Committee.\n4. OBJECTS AND AIMS\n4.1 Objects\nThe object of the Charity is to advance the education of boys and girls and in particular (but not limited to) running a\nday and/or boarding school or schools in or near Hampton and by ancillary or incidental educational activities and other\nassociated activities for the benefit of the community.\n5\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n4.2Aims\nThe Charity provides education to boys from the ages of 2Y.- 18 and girls 2Y. - 7 in its two schools, Hampton School and\nHampton Pre -Prep & Prep School.\nIn accordance with the objects, these schools aim to provide a first class independent education both through strong\nacademic tuition and through deve loping the wider sporting, artistic and social skills of their pupils. This is intended to\nprovide an environment where each pupil can develop and fulfil his or her potential, thus helping to build self-\nconfidence and inculcating a desire to contribute to the wider community. Inextricably linked with this object is the aim\nof providing public benefit to the local, national and international community.\n4.3 These objects and aims are reflected by the ethos and aims stated in the Hampton School prospectus:\nEthos\n•\nHampton is a friendly, lively and unpret entious school for boys\n•\nThe School is a community where success is based upon achievement rather than the pursuit of narrowly\ndefined targets\n•\nWe welcome academically minded pupils from both maintained and independent schools, irrespective of\nethnic group and background, and of their religious or non-religious beliefs\n•\nWe encourage every boy to develop his full academic potential and to develop skills for life through the wide\nrange of cultural, spiritual and sporting opportunities on offer\n•\nWe believe that education is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills but about developing a spirit of\nintellectual enquiry in a caring, stimulating and enjoyable environment\n•\nWe aspire to enable our boys not only to make sense of the world but also to want to go out and improve it\n•\nAbove all, our aim is for those leaving Hampton to be open-minded, tolerant and full of conviction, to have a\nclear sense of right and wrong, and to aim for personal success while supporting those around them\nWe aim\nto attract and educate pupils\n•\nof academic and all-round ambition\n•\nfrom a wide range of schools\nto provide them with\n•\na challenging and stimulating education\n•\na friendly and supportive environment\nto develop in our pupils\n•\nthe desire to achieve their full academic potential\n•\na participative but critical approach to learning\n•\na helpful and committed attitude to their School and the community\n•\nrespect for self and others\n•\ninvolvement in eo-curricular activities\n•\nskills for life at university and beyond\n6\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nWe attempt to achieve these aims through\n•\na broad and balanced curriculum\n•\nan established system of pastoral care\n•\na co-operative and collaborative relationship with the community\n•\nan extensive range of eo-curricular activities\n•\nthe development and maintenance of our site and its facilities\n5. ACCESS\nlt is important to the Governors that access to the education offered by Hampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep\nSchools is not restricted to those that can afford the fees and they are accessible to all, regardless of any disability.\nThey believe that children benefit from being taught within a diverse community since a great deal of learning occurs\nthrough social interaction, conversation and shared experiences. This learning promotes an understanding of other\npeoples' outlook and is an important training for adult life.\nThe bursary policy, accessibility plan and teaching links programme contribute to a widening of access to the education\nthe two Schools offer and the facilities they enjoy.\n5.1 Scholarships and Bursaries\nWhile the Governors view the bursary and scholarship awards as a means of ensuring a good school environment\ndrawing from all faiths, backgrounds and parts of the community, they are nonetheless aware in funding them of the\nneed for fairness between fee paying parents, many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to pay for their\nchild(ren)'s education, and those benefiting from the awards. They are also responsible for ensuring the on-going\nfinancial sustainability of the Schools, which do not have a large endowment, and aware of the need to develop their\nfacilities to remain attractive in a competitive market.\nThe Governors' policy is to award scholarships on the basis of an individual's educational and eo-curricular merit or\npotential, subject to any conditions imposed for particular awards by the original donor. They also offer bursary\nscholarships where the scholarship is supplemented by a bursary.\nBursary awards, which are available to all who meet the Schools' general entry requirements, are made solely on the\nbasis of parental means or to relieve hardship (for example in the case of redundancy) and where a student's education\nand future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Bursary awards are given up to 100% fees discount. Free Places are\nalso offered with 100% fees discount along with assistance in meeting uniform, exam and lunch costs and other\nreasonable costs including those of some educational trips. In assessing means many factors are taken into account,\nincluding family income, investments, savings and other assets, and other considerations such as the number of siblings\nand dependent relatives.\nInformation regarding bursaries is supplied in the Parent's Guide to all those applying to the Schools. Free Places are\nadvertised in the local newspaper and directly to local state primary schools.\nThe Schools attract high quality teaching and non-teaching staff through fee remissions for their children, if they meet\nthe academic admissions requirements.\nThis year the total value of awards was £2,788,211 (2015: £2,710,206) with 376 awards made as detailed in note 2 to\nthe accounts (2015:374). Bursaries totalling £1,589,948 (2015: £1,547,841) were awarded and the Governors' are\nseeking ways to increase the level of bursary funding. There were 58 pupils on a 100% Bursary or Free Places. The value\nof scholarships totalled £868,690 (2015:£800,123). Staff discounts amounted to £329,573 (2015:£362,242).\n7\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n5.2 Teaching Links and community access\nHampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Schools are part of a wider commun ity within which they are keen to\nparticipate. The Schools are ab le and want to support broader educational activities to the benefit of other children and\ntheir teachers. Examples are given below of initiatives which bring together current and past pupils, state schools and\nthe wider Hampton Community.\n5.3 Volunteers\nThe Hampton School and Hampton Pre - Prep & Prep School Parents' Associations, the Music Society and the parents of\nboys in the Boat Club voluntarily give of their time in support of the Schools by organising a variety of events and\nfunctions. Funds raised by these are used for projects which would not ordinarily be provided for within the School\nbudget.\n8\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n6. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\n6.1 Pupil numbers and Fees\nIn the year ending 31 August 2016 pupils numbered 1,296 at Hampton School and 226 at Hampton Pre -Prep & Prep.\nThe Governors consider the achievements of both Schools during that period to be excellent.\nThe termly fees, before the deduction of any means tested bursaries and scholarships, for the year ending 31 August\n2016 were:\nHampton Pre-Prep & Prep:\nHampton:\nKindergarten (whole day)\nLower School (Reception to Year 2)\nMiddle and Upper School (Years 3 - 6)\nSecondary School (Years 7 -13)\n6.2 Hampton School\n6.2 .1 General\n£3,480\n£3,730\n£4,025\n£5,850\nThe School's ethos and aims are set out in Paragraph 4.3 . The success with which it has adhered to this ethos and\nachieved these aims can be measured in the paragraphs below. These relate not only to outstanding academic\nachievement but testify to a belief in a broad education, supported by a wide-range of sporting and eo-curricular\nactivities, and a commitment to service in the community.\n6.2 .2 Academic\nA Level Results\nA Level Results for the past year were once again extremely pleasing : 30% of the grades awarded were A*s, 69% were\nat A*-A and 91% were at A*-B . Sixty six boys sat the Pre-U exam in Physics and SO sat the Pre-U History exam. Of the\nphysicists, 23 were graded D2, the equivalent of an A*, and 37 received the even higher D1 rating. Twenty seven\nhistorians were graded D2 and 13 were graded Dl. Twelve mathematicians sat the Advanced Extension Award, 1\nachieved a Distinction and 7 achieved Merits. Almost all members of the Upper Sixth secured places at an elite\nuniversity and 19 Oxbridge places were confirmed for 2016 leavers (a further three Oxbridge places were achieved via\npost-qualification applications) . As before, the range of degree courses to be taken is very wide indeed.\nThe School's results are significantly above the national figures for both maintained and independent schools and\nalmost all Fifth Year pupils stay on at Hampton for the Sixth Form . Every boy is encouraged in his School career,\nwhether perceived to be an academic ' high-flier' or not.\nGCSE and IGCSE Results\nBoys follow the more rigorous IGCSE courses in ten subjects (Art, Design & Technology, English Language and\nLiterature, French, Geography, German, History, Mathematics, Physics and Spanish). The School has again achieved an\nexcellent set of results: 91% of the grades were A*-A, while the percentage of A* grades was 68%. The national figure\nfor A* grades in 2016 was 6.52%. Thirty three boys achieved 10 A* grades and 31 achieved 9 A*s. There was a 99.83%\nA*-C grade pass rate. As well as their GCSEs and IGCSEs, 101 boys sat the OCR Free Standing Mathematics Qualification\nand 92 boys received A grades (there is no A* grade available in this qualification).\n9\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nCareers\nThe boys are supported by the Senior Tutor (Careers and UCAS) and his two Assistants and have the use of a well-\nresourced Careers Library. The Careers Department provides a w ide range of services and activities to give pupils\neducation and guidance in planning their futures. These include :\n•\ntalking to each Third Year form about GCSE options\n•\nFifth Year Morrisby career test and feedback/interview sessions\n•\nFifth Year Work Placement Scheme\n•\nSixth Form Centigrade questionnaire to initiate university and course choice\n•\nindividual support and guidance to Sixth Formers throughout the UCAS application process, as well as Gap Year\nadvice and advice regarding university choice outside the UK\nAmongst a number of events organised jointly with Lady Eleanor Holies School (LEH), there is an annual Careers\nConvention, attended by representatives from over 40 firms and institutions, a Higher Education Fair and a Gap Year\nFair . There is also a Higher Education Evening for Lower Sixth Parents. Lower Sixth pupils are allowed to make two\nuniversity visits in the Summer Term. The School again joined with Surbiton High School for a Fifth Year and Lower Sixth\nmanagement conference.\nFormer Pupils\nContact with Old Boys is maintained mainly through the Hampton Lions Alumni Office and the Old Hamptonians\nAssociation . The Hampton Lions Alumni Office supports Hamptonians after they have left School and throughout their\ncareers and beyond. lt encourages and enables former pupils to keep in touch with each other and with the School.\nStrong links between the School and its alumni community are a continuing source of mutual benefit. Old Hamptonians\noften return to the School as speakers, for example at the annual Careers Evening. A number of Old Hamptonians have\nsons who are currently pupils at the School. The School regularly receives reports of past pupils, for example when they\ngraduate from their universities or achieve successes in business, sporting, cultural or other spheres.\n6.2 .3 Clubs, Societies and eo-curricular Activities\nThe School continues to provide an extensive programme of eo-curricular activities both within the School and in the\nwider community. Not all Clubs and Societies are represented in the reports below. Others which have met regularly\nthrough the year include: Amnesty International, Art, Board Games, Book Group, Bridge, CADCAM, Chess, Classics,\nCreative Writing, Debating, Design Technology, Film-making, French, Geography, German, History, Library, The Lion,\nMandarin, Mathematics, Model United Nations, Philosophy Circle, Photography and Science.

A group of First Years enjoyed a coasteering, kayaking and sea-cliff climbing trip in Dorset. A large\ngroup of Sixth formers, both from Hampton and LEH, travelled to Borneo in July to undertake community and\nconservation work near Kudat . Other activities included climbing Mount Kinabalu, snorkell ing, scuba diving and visiting\nthe orangutan rehabilitation centre in Sepilok and the Kretam Palm Oil Plantation.\n10\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nBadman Shepherd Travel Awards\nSince 1980 annual awards have been made from a fund set up in memory of Mr E R Badman, a former Deputy\nHeadmaster, to help enable boys to travel, in this country or abroad, for educational purposes, in pursuit of some\ninterest or for adventure. This fund was supplemented in 1994 from the legacy of Mr AT Shepherd, an Old\nHamptonian and former Chairman of Governors . Four awards were made this year, to support boys travelling in Europe\nand Asia.\nCombined Cadet Force {CCF}\nThe Contingent has continued to parade every Friday afternoon in conjunction with pupils from LEH and Hampton High.\nNew members enjoyed our autumn recruits' field day in Hampshire and a leadership camp at Hampton in October. The\nCCF again observed Remembrance Day by parading through Hampton. Following school-based training, 12 cadets were\npromoted to Corporal or Lance-Corporal. The RAF Section came fourth in the Regional Air Squadron Trophy\ncompetition, improving from fifth place last year. Alex Witt won an Air Cadet Pilot Scheme Award, which will enable\nhim, after training, to fly solo. Both he and Thomas Lane have gained places on an RAF Leadership Course held at RAF\nCranwell in July. A Summer Field Day was held at RAF Northolt. This year's Summer Camps were held at St Martin's\nPlain in Kent (military training for the Army and RAF Sections) and West Wales (Adventurous Training, again for both\nsections).\nDrama\nThis year's productions highlighted the breadth and versatility of Hampton pupil's performing art skills. They began with\nthe annual Hampton and LEH musical, Mack and Mabel, in which Rahul Jaitly delivered a sophisticated portrayal of the\ncharismatic yet vulnerable Mack. Hampton and LEH collaborated later in the year in a modern-dress production of\nShakespeare's Julius Caesar, for which an original score was composed by Thomas Duggan, Edward Owens and Angus\nShennan. Special mention must go to Duncan Boyle (who played Anthony) and Ruairi Pyrgos (Julius Caesar) for their\nevocative performances.\nOther highlights from the year included Greenlawns in Winter, the Junior Drama Christmas Play (written by Community\nPlaywright Jennifer Dud a and in which Patrick Silcox played the ailing Ted Edwards with great empathy) and the Lower\nSchool play, Treasure Island, led by three Sixth Formers: Oscar Cloud, Joe Jenkins and Tom Ackery.\nThis year's projects and performances also included:\nFifth Year Performances: Steven Berkoffs The Trial and R.C . Sheriffs Journey's End (December)\nThird Year Devised Plays (January and April)\nFourth Year Performances: Nigel William's adaptation of Gelding's Lord of the Flies (March)\nSecond Year Devised Plays (March)\nGCSE Productions: a selection of scripted performances (May)\nAS Level Production: Reginald Rose's Twelve Angry Men (May)\n11\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nDuke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme\nTwo hundred boys were involved in the Award this year. Of these, 120 completed their Bronze Award practice and\nassessment expeditions in the Surrey Hills and Ashdown Forest and 60 completed their Silver practice and assessment\nexped itions in either Dorset or the New Forest. In October, 12 Gold and 2 Silver Award candidates completed their\npractice expeditions in the Lake District, 7 completed expeditions in Snowdonia at Easter, and 11 their practice\nexpeditions in the Lake District in June.\nFaith Societies\nThere are two Christian Forums, the Junior (First to Fourth Years) and Senior (Fifth Years and Sixth Form).

We value thinking of others first, as well as not giving up. Our academic programme is\nbroad and balanced. Results do matter here, as they should, but meaningful progress matters too; the pleasure of\nknowing you have tried your best and have been recognised for that is a feeling that ought to inspire and endure long\nafter our days at prep school are over. We believe this is a critically important function of our role in terms of preparing\nall our pupils for successful transfer to a senior school that will be the best fit for them.\nFebruary, 2016 saw the Prep pupils and staff occupy our magnificent, new building. This momentous event was the\nculmination of many years of hard work and dedication from a great range of stakeholders and it cannot be stated\nenough what an incredible impact this event has had on the life of the School. We also changed our name from\nDen mead to Hampton Pre-P rep & Prep, to better reflect the close and collaborative nature of the relationship we enjoy\nwith Hampton School.\nInvolvement by all pupils in the extensive eo-curricular programme ofthe School is a fundamental aspect of their time\nhere. Regardless of ability in sport or the arts, children are enthusiastically encouraged to participate to the best of\ntheir ability. The extensive games programme provides many opportunities to represent the School and performing\narts productions are ambitious and imaginative. The residential trips undertaken by Years 3 to 6 not only provide a\nbreath-taking array of activities for them to try, but also valuable lessons in citizenship.\nSuccessful personal relationships sit at the heart of any successful community. We want our pupils to be confident and\nkind, happy, considerate and well-mannered. lt is a source of great joy to see these qualities, in every child, flourish.\n15\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n6.3 .2 Admissions and Pupil Numbers\nCurrently the School is full from Years 1- 6, w ith the Kindergarten and Reception Year groups close to full.

In November 2016 we will be holding a further Open Morning plus our 7+\nAssessment Morning for pupils seeking a place in Year 3, September 2017.\n6.3 .3Developments and Maintenance\nThe construction of the new Prep building on the Gloucester Road was completed in time for occupation at the\nbeginning of the summer 2016 term.\n6.4 Fund raising performance\nThere were no material fundraising activities in the year.\n16\n•\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n7 PUBLIC BENEFIT\nHampton School has always taken and will continue to take its responsibilities as a charitable trust very seriously. The\nSchool will continue to contribute a great deal to the community. lt will, with reference to the Charities Act 2006:\n1. maintain and enhance its impressive list of public benefit activities;\n2. seek to raise new funds devoted to means-tested entry bursaries and by transferring funds from non-means-\ntested awards; and\n3. provide more means-tested Free Places.\nThe staff and pupils of the School continue to commit a great deal of time and effort to providing a wide range of public\nbenefit locally, nationally and internationally. A detailed list of Hampton School's Public Benefit work may be found on\nthe School's website, some examples of their activities are shown below. lt is a great tribute to the ethos of the School\nthat our pupils are so willing to support so many activities.\nHampton School has registered on the ISC Schools Together website and has uploaded examples of projects, including\nmathematics support for Reach Academy students and lunchtime sport and eo-curricular support for locally based\nClarendon School.\nThe Hampton Independent-State Schools Partnership {ISSP) is a link between two independent schools (Hampton\nSchool and Lady Eleanor Holies [LEH]) and five maintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and\nKingston upon Thames (Orleans Park School, Hampton High, Tolworth Girls' School, Teddington School and Hollyfield\nSchool).\nThe Hampton ISSP exists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools listed above. Over time, we have\ntogether built up a lively and varied programme of educational and eo-curricular opportunities, alongside the provision\nof academic support throughout the year. This has enabled pupils and teachers across the partnership to work\ncollaboratively and to draw upon the particular strengths of each school. All schools within the Hampton ISSP are\ninvited to host events across the year, during which pupils join together for activities including the following:\nMathematics, IT, Science, Design & Technology, Public Speaking, Dance, Music, and a Model United Nations\nConference.\nFor many years, the Hampton ISSP schools have supported each other with GCSE revision sessions run at weekends\nacross a range of subjects, resulting in an improvement in the final grades awarded. Pupils from the state-funded\nmember schools have been able to enjoy educational opportunities which would not otherwise have been available to\nthem, such as courses in A Level Further Mathematics. We have also been delighted to see 43 Year 8 pupils from our\nstate-funded partners enrol recently in the second iteration of a three-year Latin course run by two members of\nHampton School's Classics Department.\nThe Hampton ISSP has also led to the sharing of many of Hampton School's facilities by schools within the partnership:\nHampton School's sports facilities are used regularly by one of the schools within the partnership and joint theatre\nproductions take place on a regular basis in Hampton's Hammond Theatre.\nAs a charity the parents of our pupils have the assurance that all the income of the School must be applied for\neducational purposes. As an educational charity we enjoy tax exemption on our educational activities and on our\ninvestment income and gains provided these are applied for our charitable aims. We are entitled to an 80% reduction\non our business rates on the property we occupy for our charitable purposes. The financial benefits we receive from\nthis tax exemption are all applied for educational purposes and indirectly help us to maintain our bursary policy and our\npartnerships programme with maintained schools. However, as an educational charity, we are unable to reclaim VAT\ninput tax on our costs as we are exempt for VAT purposes. We also pay tax as an employer through the national\ninsurance contributions we make.\nIn addition to the very substantial benefits our School brings to our pupils, the local community and society through the\neducation we provide, our bursary and partnerships programmes create a social asset without cost to the Exchequer.\n17\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nIn the past year the Hampton School Trust has educated 1,522 pupils, relieving the UK public expenditure by around £9\nmillion.\nThe Governors have had regard to the general guidance from the Charity Commission on public benefit when\ndetermining the School's objectives.\n7.1 Hampton School Public Benefit Activities:\nAcademic\n•\nA member of the Classics Department is teaching Latin GCSE to 10 pupils from local secondary schools\n•\nTwo Sixth Form pupils have been helping teach Latin each week to pupils at the Sir Richard Reynolds\nSecondary School in Twickenham\n•\nA member of the History Department o rganised a Holocaust workshop for over 100 pupils from 6 local schools.\nThese pupils were later joined by parents and members of the local community to hear an address by a\nHolocaust survivor\n•\nHampton School has been designated a Beacon School by UCL's Centre for Holocaust Education.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in\nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102), the Companies Act 2006 and the Statement of Recommended Practice\napplicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in\nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102)- effective 1 January 201S . The date of transition to FRS102 was 1\nSeptember 2014 and in preparing the financial statements, the Trustees have considered whether the accounting\npolicies required by the standard necessitate the restatement of comparative information. There have been no\nnumerical changes as a result of the transition to FRS 102, the reserves position is unadjusted from the previously\nreported position.\nThe accounts are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, as modified by the revaluation of\ninvestments.\nThe School is a Public Benefit Ent ity registered as a charity in England and Wales . Hampton School Foundation\nCharity became a charitable company, limited by guarantee, on 1 September 2007.\nGoing concern\nHaving reviewed the School's future projected cash flows and the funding facilities available to the School\ntogether with the expected ongoing demand for places, the Governors have a reasonable expectation that the\nSchool has adequate resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and consider that there were\nno material uncertainties over the School's financial viability. Accordingly, they also continue to adopt the going\nconcern basis in preparing the financial statements as outlined in the Statement of Accounting and Reporting\nResponsibilities on page 25.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the accounting policies, Governors are required to make judgement, estimates and\nassumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are\nconsidered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the\nperiod of the revision and future periods if the revision affected current and future periods.\nJudgements made by the Governors in the application of these policies that have significant effect on the financial\nstatements and estimates with a sign ificant risk of material misstatement in the next year are deemed to be in\nrelation to the depreciation rates of tangible fixed assets and are discussed below.\nIn the view of the Governors, no assumptions concerning the future or estimation uncertainty affecting assets or\nliabilities at the balance sheet date are likely to result in a material adjustment to their carrying amounts in the\nnext fina ncial year.\n32\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered\nmaterial in relation to the School's financial statements.\nFees and similar earned income\nFees receivable and charges for services and use of the premises, less any allowances, scholarships, bursaries\ngranted by the School against those fees, but including contributions received from restricted funds, are\naccounted for in the period in which the service is provided.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income from dividends, bank balances and fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals\nbasis .\nDonations, legacies, grants and other voluntary income\nVoluntary income is accounted for as and when entitlement arises, the amount can be reliably quantified and the\neconomic benefit to the School is considered probable.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings on a direct cost basis. The irrecoverable element of VAT is included\nwith the item of expense to which it relates. Any expenses incurred with recoverable VAT are shown net of VAT.\nTangible fixed assets and depreciation\nItems purchased with a cost of greater than £5,000 are depreciated. Depreciation is provided at the following\nannual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful economic life.\nFurniture, fixtures & fittings, office equipment\nKitchen, administrative and teaching equipment\nMotorised equipment\nComputer equipment\nSecurity & control systems\nProperty improvements\nMotor vehicles\nRowing boats\nFreehold property\nLeasehold property\nAnnual impairment reviews are carried out.\n15% on cost\n15% on cost\n20% on cost\n50% on cost\n33.3% on cost\n10% on cost\n25% on cost\n10% on cost\n2% on cost with 10% residual value\n2% on cost with 10% residual value or term of\nlease if shorter\nWhere assets are fully depreciated by the balance sheet date they are eliminated from the accounts in the\nfollowing year.\nFund accounting\n•\nUnrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the Governors in furtherance of the general\nobjectives of the Charity .\n•\nDesignated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the Governors for particular purposes.\n•\nRestricted funds are subject to restrictions on their expenditure imposed by the donor.\n•\nEndowment funds are held permanently and are represented by investments and certain property.\n33\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nPension Schemes\nThe School contributes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme and to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames\nPension Fund at rates set by their actuaries and advised to the school by their administrators. These are defined\nbenefit multi-employer pension schemes. For the former it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities of\nthe scheme that are attributable to the School and the School does not benefit from any surpluses on the scheme\nnor share in any losses. Accordingly, under FRS 102 the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined\ncontribution scheme. The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Pension Fund was closed to support staff\njoining the School after 1 April 2009. The School also contributes to The Pensions Trust Pension Scheme for\nsupport staff joining the School after 1 April 2009. This is a money purchase scheme with a current employer\ncontribution of 8% per annum and employee contribution of 4% per annum.\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames 2015 information has been restated where necessary to comply\nwith FRS 102.\nOperating Leases\nRentals payable are charged on a time basis over the lease term.\nRealised and unrealised gains/losses\nRealised gains/losses are recorded in the accounts at the date of disposal. Unrealised gains/losses are recorded at\nthe balance sheet date.\nAdvanced Fee Payments\nParents may enter into a contract with the School to pay tuition fees in advance and by doing so they receive a\ndiscount.\nAcceptance Deposits\nWhen parents choose not to send a pupil to the School after formally accepting a place the acceptance deposit is\nretained according to the School's terms and conditions.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nBasic financial cost instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost with the exception of investments which are held at fair value. Financial assets held at amortised\ncost comprise cash at bank and in hand, together with trade and other debtors. A specific provision is made for\ndebts for which recoverability is in doubt. Cash at bank and in hand is defined as all cash held in instant access\nbank accounts and used as working capital. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise all creditors except\nsocial security and other taxes and provisions. Assets and liabilities held in foreign currency are translated to\nsterling at the balance sheet date at an appropriate exchange rate.\n34\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n2.

This success was very\npublicly recognised by the team from the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISi) which inspected the Schools in March\n2016. Its Report highlighted the very many excellent areas of the Schools’ activities and particularly concluded for\nHampton School: “The quality of the pupils’ achievements in academic and co-curricular areas is exceptional”. It went\non to declare that the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, together with the quality of\ngovernance, is excellent. Such external recognition of the effectiveness of our approach is welcome but unsurprising\nin the light of the extraordinary range of talent and dedication exhibited by staff and pupils alike, driving the many\nactivities and results described in the Governors’ Report below.\nA significant development for the Hampton School Trust, as signalled in my Report last year, has been the\nestablishment of the Fitzwygram Foundation, incorporated in March 2016. This associated charity has been set up\nwith the primary object of providing grant funding for the provision of bursaries to pupils and prospective pupils of the\nSchools. While the Foundation has not yet started fundraising, the Trust has nonetheless once more increased the\nvalue of bursaries awarded over the last year. The Fitzwygram Foundation is being developed in conjunction with an\never widening community of Hampton alumni who are keen to support the School in a variety of different ways.\nConcurrently the Hampton School community has been busy contributing to the Hampton Independent-State Schools\nPartnership (ISSP), a link between two independent schools (Hampton School and Lady Eleanor Holles [LEH]) and five\nmaintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames. The Hampton ISSP\nexists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools, and in doing so provides educational opportunities to\nthose from state-funded member schools which would not otherwise have been available to them. It has led to the\nsharing of many of Hampton School’s facilities, including its sports infrastructure and The Hammond Theatre, all of\nwhich are also used regularly by both the local and wider communities.\nThe Trust’s premises have been considerably enhanced by the completion, at the end of February 2016, of our\nmagnificent new Prep School building. The opening coincided with a change of name, from Denmead to Hampton Pre-\nPrep and Prep School, representing an exciting new phase in the life of the School and reflecting the closely\ncollaborative relationship with Hampton itself.\nAcademic results were again very impressive, with 91% of the grades awarded as A*-B at A Level. Of the 66 boys\nsitting the physics Pre-U exam, no fewer than 60 achieved the equivalent of an A* (D2) or above (D1). Almost all\nmembers of the Upper Sixth secured places at an elite university and 19 Oxbridge places were confirmed for 2016\nleavers. At GCSE the School achieved another excellent set of results: 91% of the grades were A*-A, with a 99.83% A*-\nC pass rate.\nThe continuing success of Hampton'’s pupils in their many sporting activities is not limited to their playing for the\nSchool. Four of our cricketers were selected for national programmes and five were awarded outside club or County\ncolours. In football seven boys were selected to represent ISFA nationally and five for ISFA London. Three of our\nrowers won international colours for Great Britain, and twenty nine Hampton rugby players were selected for\ndevelopment groups or pathways with a range of major national clubs. A further two were awarded International\nColours (USA) and one signed a professional Rugby Sevens contract.\nWithin an extensive programme of performing arts over the year highlights included the musical “Mack and Mabel” in\nconjunction with Lady Eleanor Holles and the School Jazz Bands giving three concerts in Malta in July. Hampton’s male\nvoice choir “Voices of Lions” reached the national selection stage at The Choir of the Year 2016 competition; they gave\neight concerts at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nFinally I can once again conclude this Chairman’s Report by noting that the finances of the Hampton School Trust\nremain extremely robust. As in previous years we have produced a modest surplus to be re-invested back into ongoing\nimprovement of the School infrastructures. In spite of it being a time of some political and financial uncertainty our\nSchools are full and our lists of applicants continue to grow. It is not however a time for complacency. As Governors\nwe continue our dedication both to providing the best possible education for our pupils and to developing the means to\nincrease the access to the School for capable pupils whose financial circumstances would otherwise preclude them.\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nHampton School Governors\nThe Governors are the charity trustees and directors of the company and have all served in office throughout the year except where indicated.\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n:' Hamp:oiniPrei- De&EE;Fnent& 1 .

CONSTITUTION\nHampton School is a charitable company limited by guarantee. It incorporates and runs two schools, Hampton School\nand Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School. Both Schools have the same Department for Education number, 318/6071. The\nSchools are governed by the same Governing Body. The accounts of Hampton School Trust are amalgamated with\nthose of the company; following an order made by the Charity Commission on 17 August 2007, under charity number\n1120005.\n2. GOVERNING INSTRUMENT\nThe Company is governed by its Memorandum of Association dated 14 May 2007 and Articles of Association dated 28\nNovember 2007. Governors are also guided by the Scheme of Management and Delegation which includes Terms of\nReference for the sub-committees:\nThe Finance Committee\nThe Development and General Purposes Committee\nThe Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee\nThe Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Committee\nThe Bursary Fund Committee\n3. GOVERNANCE\nThe Governors are required to be members of the Company and are also Trustees and Directors. Governors are\nresponsible for the overall management and control of Hampton School and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School and they\nusually meet at least four times a year. The work of implementing most of their policies is carried out by the members\nof the Development and General Purpose Committee and the Finance Committee which meet before each meeting of\nthe full Governing Board. The Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep and Bursary Fund Committees meet at least three times per\nyear and the Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee once per year. The Governors have continued to pay\nclose attention to their safeguarding obligations and those of the School community in general. The Governors monitor\nthe effectiveness of the Schools’ safeguarding policies through the receipt, discussion and review of regular reports\nfrom the Schools’ Safeguarding Lead and Officers and the nominated safeguarding Governors. There are currently two\nGovernors so nominated and they are available, whenever required, to advise and assist the Schools’ Designated\nSafeguarding Lead and Officers in exercising the Schools’ duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and\nyoung people.\nThe Chairs of the sub-committees are appointed at the first meeting every calendar year and the members are listed at\nthe start of this report.\n3.1 Governor Recruitment and Training\nThe Governing Body requires breadth and depth of experience to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently. Where\npossible the composition should comprise the following:\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n \ne A Governor with a legal background\ne A Governor with a financial / accounting background\ne A Governor with education experience\ne A Governor with senior managerial or business experience\ne A Governor with experience of equal opportunities and disability needs\ne Atleast one female Governor and at least one male Governor\nOne Governor may meet one or more of these requirements.\nThe process of appointment is:\ne A potential Governor is nominated subject to the criteria laid down by the Remuneration and Governor\nSelection Committee\ne Discussions about the nomination take place with the Chairman of Governors, Headmaster and Clerk to the\nGovernors\n¢ |f a potential Governor is identified as having specific required skills his/her CV is submitted to all Governors for\nprovisional approval\ne The potential Governor usually meets the Governors informally prior to a Governors’ meeting and visits the\nSchools and meets senior staff\ne Subject to final Governors’ approval the Governor is selected\nFollowing appointment, a comprehensive information pack including past Governors’ minutes, accounts, the Charitable\nScheme and details of the role of a Trustee is given to the new Governor.

Governors are encouraged to visit the Schools on a regular\nbasis.\nNo remuneration is paid to Governors.\n3.2 Organisational Management\nThe Governors determine the general policy of the schools. The day-to-day running of the Schools is delegated to the\nHeadmaster, supported by senior staff. The Headmaster and Bursar are invited to attend Governors’ meetings.\nThe Governors’ Remuneration & Governor Selection Committee meets annually in the Spring Term to consider the\nremuneration of Hampton School Trust senior staff (key management personnel), taking into account\nrecommendations put forward by the Headmaster. The Committee recommends remuneration levels which are\nratified by the Governors at their meeting at the end of the Spring Term. Once ratified, senior staff remuneration levels\nare communicated to them by the Headmaster and Bursar as appropriate. The Headmaster’s remuneration is reviewed\nseparately on an annual basis by the Chairman of the Governors in consultation with the Remuneration & Governor\nSelection Committee.\n4. OBIJECTS AND AIMS\n4.1 Objects\nThe object of the Charity is to advance the education of boys and girls and in particular (but not limited to) running a\nday and/or boarding school or schools in or near Hampton and by ancillary or incidental educational activities and other\nassociated activities for the benefit of the community.\nHAMPTON SCHOOL GOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016 4.2 Aims The Charity provides education to boys from the ages of 2% - 18 and girls 2% - 7 in its two schools, Hamptbn School and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School. In accordance with the objects, these schools aim to provide a first class independent education both through strong academic tuition and through developing the wider sporting, artistic and social skills of their pupils. This is intended to provide an environment where each pupil can develop and fulfil his or her potential, thus helping to build self- confidence and inculcating a desire to contribute to the wider community. Inextricably linked with this object is the aim of providing public benefit to the local, national and international community. 4.3 These objects and aims are reflected by the ethos and aims stated in the Hampton School prospectus: Ethos\nWe aim Hampton is a friendly, lively and unpretentious school for boys\nThe School is a community where success is based upon achievement rather than the pursuit of narrowly\ndefined targets\nWe welcome academically minded pupils from both maintained and independent schools, irrespective of\nethnic group and background, and of their religious or non-religious beliefs\nWe encourage every boy to develop his full academic potential and to develop skills for life through the wide\nrange of cultural, spiritual and sporting opportunities on offer\nWe believe that education is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills but about developing a spirit of\nintellectual enquiry in a caring, stimulating and enjoyable environment\nWe aspire to enable our boys not only to make sense of the world but also to want to go out and improve it\nAbove all, our aim is for those leaving Hampton to be open-minded, tolerant and full of conviction, to have a\nclear sense of right and wrong, and to aim for personal success while supporting those around them\nto attract and educate pupils of academic and all-round ambition\nfrom a wide range of schools\nto provide them with a challenging and stimulating education\na friendly and supportive environment\nto develop in our pupils the desire to achieve their full academic potential\na participative but critical approach to learning\na helpful and committed attitude to their School and the community\nrespect for self and others\ninvolvement in co-curricular activities\nskills for life at university and beyond\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nWe attempt to achieve these aims through\na broad and balanced curriculum\nan established system of pastoral care\na co-operative and collaborative relationship with the community\nan extensive range of co-curricular activities\nthe development and maintenance of our site and its facilities\n5. ACCESS\nIt is important to the Governors that access to the education offered by Hampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep\nSchools is not restricted to those that can afford the fees and they are accessible to all, regardless of any disability.\nThey believe that children benefit from being taught within a diverse community since a great deal of learning occurs\nthrough social interaction, conversation and shared experiences. This learning promotes an understanding of other\npeoples’ outlook and is an important training for adult life.\nThe bursary policy, accessibility plan and teaching links programme contribute to a widening of access to the education\nthe two Schools offer and the facilities they enjoy.\n5.1 Scholarships and Bursaries\nWhile the Governors view the bursary and scholarship awards as a means of ensuring a good school environment\ndrawing from all faiths, backgrounds and parts of the community, they are nonetheless aware in funding them of the\nneed for fairness between fee paying parents, many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to pay for their\nchild(ren)’s education, and those benefiting from the awards. They are also responsible for ensuring the on-going\nfinancial sustainability of the Schools, which do not have a large endowment, and aware of the need to develop their\nfacilities to remain attractive in a competitive market.\nThe Governors’ policy is to award scholarships on the basis of an individual’s educational and co-curricular merit or\npotential, subject to any conditions imposed for particular awards by the original donor. They also offer bursary\nscholarships where the scholarship is supplemented by a bursary.\nBursary awards, which are available to all who meet the Schools’ general entry requirements, are made solely on the\nbasis of parental means or to relieve hardship (for example in the case of redundancy) and where a student’s education\nand future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Bursary awards are given up to 100% fees discount. Free Places are\nalso offered with 100% fees discount along with assistance in meeting uniform, exam and lunch costs and other\nreasonable costs including those of some educational trips. In assessing means many factors are taken into account,\nincluding family income, investments, savings and other assets, and other considerations such as the number of siblings\nand dependent relatives.\nInformation regarding bursaries is supplied in the Parent’s Guide to all those applying to the Schools. Free Places are\nadvertised in the local newspaper and directly to local state primary schools.\nThe Schools attract high quality teaching and non-teaching staff through fee remissions for their children, if they meet\nthe academic admissions requirements.\nThis year the total value of awards was £2,788,211 (2015: £2,710,206) with 376 awards made as detailed in note 2 to\nthe accounts (2015:374). Bursaries totalling £1,589,948 (2015: £1,547,841) were awarded and the Governors’ are\nseeking ways to increase the level of bursary funding. There were 58 pupils on a 100% Bursary or Free Places. The value\nof scholarships totalled £868,690 (2015:£800,123). Staff discounts amounted to £329,573 (2015:£362,242).\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n5.2 Teaching Links and community access\nHampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Schools are part of a wider community within which they are keen to\nparticipate. The Schools are able and want to support broader educational activities to the benefit of other children and\ntheir teachers. Examples are given below of initiatives which bring together current and past pupils, state schools and\nthe wider Hampton Community.\n5.3 Volunteers\nThe Hampton School and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School Parents’ Associations, the Music Society and the parents of\nboys in the Boat Club voluntarily give of their time in support of the Schools by organising a variety of events and\nfunctions. Funds raised by these are used for projects which would not ordinarily be provided for within the School\nbudget.\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n6. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\n6.1 Pupil numbers and Fees\nIn the year ending 31 August 2016 pupils numbered 1,296 at Hampton School and 226 at Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep.\nThe Governors consider the achievements of both Schools during that period to be excellent.\nThe termly fees, before the deduction of any means tested bursaries and scholarships, for the year ending 31 August\n2016 were:\nHampton Pre-Prep & Prep:\nKindergarten (whole day) £3,480\nLower School (Reception to Year 2) £3,730\nMiddle and Upper School (Years 3 - 6) £4,025\nHampton:\nSecondary School (Years 7 - 13) £5,850\n6.2 Hampton School\n6.2.1 General\nThe School’s ethos and aims are set out in Paragraph 4.3. The success with which it has adhered to this ethos and\nachieved these aims can be measured in the paragraphs below.

We value thinking of others first, as well as not giving up. Our academic programme is\nbroad and balanced. Results do matter here, as they should, but meaningful progress matters too; the pleasure of\nknowing you have tried your best and have been recognised for that is a feeling that ought to inspire and endure long\nafter our days at prep school are over. We believe this is a critically important function of our role in terms of preparing\nall our pupils for successful transfer to a senior school that will be the best fit for them.\nFebruary, 2016 saw the Prep pupils and staff occupy our magnificent, new building. This momentous event was the\nculmination of many years of hard work and dedication from a great range of stakeholders and it cannot be stated\nenough what an incredible impact this event has had on the life of the School. We also changed our name from\nDenmead to Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep, to better reflect the close and collaborative nature of the relationship we enjoy\nwith Hampton School.\nInvolvement by all pupils in the extensive co-curricular programme of the School is a fundamental aspect of their time\nhere. Regardless of ability in sport or the arts, children are enthusiastically encouraged to participate to the best of\ntheir ability. The extensive games programme provides many opportunities to represent the School and performing\narts productions are ambitious and imaginative. The residential trips undertaken by Years 3 to 6 not only provide a\nbreath-taking array of activities for them to try, but also valuable lessons in citizenship.\nSuccessful personal relationships sit at the heart of any successful community. We want our pupils to be confident and\nkind, happy, considerate and well-mannered. It is a source of great joy to see these qualities, in every child, flourish.\n15\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n6.3.2 Admissions and Pupil Numbers\nCurrently the School is full from Years 1 - 6, with the Kindergarten and Reception Year groups close to full.

This new\nformat worked extremely well and we managed more than satisfactorily with the greatly increased numbers of\nprospective parents who visited us on this occasion. Close to 100 families visited the Pre-Prep & Prep. Interest in places\nfor all Year groups continues to grow. In November 2016 we will be holding a further Open Morning plus our 7+\nAssessment Morning for pupils seeking a place in Year 3, September 2017.\n6.3.3Developments and Maintenance\nThe construction of the new Prep building on the Gloucester Road was completed in time for occupation at the\nbeginning of the summer 2016 term.\n6.4 Fundraising performance\nThere were no material fundraising activities in the year.\n16\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n \n \n \n7 PUBLIC BENEFIT\nHampton School has always taken and will continue to take its responsibilities as a charitable trust very seriously. The\nSchool will continue to contribute a great deal to the community. It will, with reference to the Charities Act 2006:\n1. maintain and enhance its impressive list of public benefit activities;\n2. seek to raise new funds devoted to means-tested entry bursaries and by transferring funds from non-means-\ntested awards; and\n3. provide more means-tested Free Places.\nThe staff and pupils of the School continue to commit a great deal of time and effort to providing a wide range of public\nbenefit locally, nationally and internationally. A detailed list of Hampton School’s Public Benefit work may be found on\nthe School’s website, some examples of their activities are shown below. It is a great tribute to the ethos of the School\nthat our pupils are so willing to support so many activities.\nHampton School has registered on the ISC Schools Together website and has uploaded examples of projects, including\nmathematics support for Reach Academy students and lunchtime sport and co-curricular support for locally based\nClarendon School.\nThe Hampton Independent-State Schools Partnership (ISSP) is a link between two independent schools {(Hampton\nSchool and Lady Eleanor Holles [LEH]) and five maintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and\nKingston upon Thames (Orleans Park School, Hampton High, Tolworth Girls’ School, Teddington School and Hollyfield\nSchool).\nThe Hampton ISSP exists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools listed above. Over time, we have\ntogether built up a lively and varied programme of educational and co-curricular opportunities, alongside the provision\nof academic support throughout the year. This has enabled pupils and teachers across the partnership to work\ncollaboratively and to draw upon the particular strengths of each school. All schools within the Hampton ISSP are\ninvited to host events across the year, during which pupils join together for activities including the following:\nMathematics, IT, Science, Design & Technology, Public Speaking, Dance, Music, and a Model United Nations\nConference.\nFor many years, the Hampton ISSP schools have supported each other with GCSE revision sessions run at weekends\nacross a range of subjects, resulting in an improvement in the final grades awarded. Pupils from the state-funded\nmember schools have been able to enjoy educational opportunities which would not otherwise have been available to\nthem, such as courses in A Level Further Mathematics. We have also been delighted to see 43 Year 8 pupils from our\nstate-funded partners enrol recently in the second iteration of a three-year Latin course run by two members of\nHampton School’s Classics Department.\nThe Hampton ISSP has also led to the sharing of many of Hampton School’s facilities by schools within the partnership:\nHampton School’s sports facilities are used regularly by one of the schools within the partnership and joint theatre\nproductions take place on a regular basis in Hampton’s Hammond Theatre.\nAs a charity the parents of our pupils have the assurance that all the income of the School must be applied for\neducational purposes. As an educational charity we enjoy tax exemption on our educational activities and on our\ninvestment income and gains provided these are applied for our charitable aims. We are entitled to an 80% reduction\non our business rates on the property we occupy for our charitable purposes. The financial benefits we receive from\nthis tax exemption are all applied for educational purposes and indirectly help us to maintain our bursary policy and our\npartnerships programme with maintained schools. However, as an educational charity, we are unable to reclaim VAT\ninput tax on our costs as we are exempt for VAT purposes. We also pay tax as an employer through the national\ninsurance contributions we make.\nIn addition to the very substantial benefits our School brings to our pupils, the local community and society through the\neducation we provide, our bursary and partnerships programmes create a social asset without cost to the Exchequer.\n17\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nIn the past year the Hampton School Trust has educated 1,522 pupils, relieving the UK public expenditure by around £9\nmillion.\nThe Governors have had regard to the general guidance from the Charity Commission on public benefit when\ndetermining the School’s objectives.\n7.1 Hampton School Public Benefit Activities:\nAcademic\ne A member of the Classics Department is teaching Latin GCSE to 10 pupils from local secondary schools\ne  Two Sixth Form pupils have been helping teach Latin each week to pupils at the Sir Richard Reynolds\nSecondary School in Twickenham\ne A member of the History Department organised a Holocaust workshop for over 100 pupils from 6 local schools.\nThese pupils were later joined by parents and members of the local community to hear an address by a\nHolocaust survivor\ne  Hampton School has been designated a Beacon School by UCL’s Centre for Holocaust Education.

Detailed considerations of risk are\ndelegated to the Senior Management of the Schools apart from those relating to the Board and its membership. Risks\nare identified and assessed and controls are established throughout the year. A formal written review of the Charity’s\nrisk management processes is undertaken on an annual basis.\nThis review covers the major risks and uncertainties common to all independent schools (for example, maintenance of\nhigh quality teaching staff; attraction of planned for pupil numbers; effective and controlled funding for development;\nsafeguarding; development of increasing public benefit) but also includes any more immediate, specific and shorter\nterm uncertainties\nThrough such reviews and the overall risk management processes established for the Schools, the Governors are\nsatisfied that the principal risks identified have been adequately mitigated where possible. It is recognised that systems\ncan only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that major risks have been adequately managed.\nThe principal risks currently identified ion the School’s risk register are:\nRisk Mitigation\nEffectiveness of the safeguarding policy and  Appointment of Designated Safeguarding Lead & Officers, nominating\nprocedures including the ""Prevent” duty Governors with lead safeguarding responsibility and routine reporting\nat Board meetings\nRecruitment and retention of staff Competitive salary and benefits including consideration to provide\naccommodation\nCompliance with the Public Benefit test Extensive discussion, preparation and planning.\nMonitoring and recording of the Public Benefits provided\nICT systems not fit for purpose Assessment of ICT systems by an external consultant and\nimplementation of their recommendations\nData loss or data protection infringement Robust policies, regular system backup and encryption of laptops\nThe Governors had previously identified the standard of accommodation at the Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Gloucester\nRoad site as a principal risk. The rebuild of this facility was completed in early 2016.\n22\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n \n9. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n9.1 Financial Results\nThe financial statements show net income from unrestricted funds for the year of £2,582,310 (2015:£1,563,099).\nNet cash inflow from operating activities for the year was £3,946,875 (2015:£3,567,534).\nThe Governors are continuing their policy of deploying all net income to enhance the Schools’ charitable objectives.\n9.2 Investment Powers\nInvesting activities are governed by the Trustee Act 2000.\n9.3 Investment Policy\nThe Trustees use GAM London Limited (GAM) to manage the Trust’s investment portfolio. The Trustees continue to\ninstruct GAM to adopt a medium-risk approach to increase the value of the portfolio. The objective given to GAM in\n2015 was to increase the portfolio value between 7% and 10% per annum over the investment cycle.\n9.4 Investment Performance\nIn the financial year the Investments have performed in accordance with the market, expectations and the relevant\nindices.\n9.5 Fundraising Performance\nThe School received donations by regular gift aid payments from previous Appeals of £6,382.\n9.6 Asset Cover for Funds\nNote 18 to the accounts sets out an analysis of the net assets attributable to the various funds of the Charity. These\nassets are sufficient to meet the Charity’s needs.\n9.7 Pension Liability\nThe Governors recognise the liability existing in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames pension scheme for\nnon-teaching staff —~ see notes 20 and 21. The pension liability has been reported within the accounts in accordance\nwith FRS 102.\n23\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n9.8 Other Relationships:\n9.8.1 Millennium Boathouse\nThe administration of this facility is divided between Hampton School and Lady Eleanor Holles School (LEH). Hampton\nSchool has responsibility for the maintenance of the site and LEH for all financial operations. For ease of administration\nthe complete revenue and costs are recorded in the accounts of LEH and audited as part of its accounts. A yearly\nreconciliation takes place thus ensuring income and expenditure is evenly shared and recorded in the respective\naccounts.\n9.8.2 PupilCoach Limited\nPupilCoach Limited is a joint trading company wholly owned in equal shares by Hampton School and LEH. The company\nprovides a service to parents requiring help in transporting their children to and from school.\nThe licensed coaches currently carry over 1,100 pupils a day on twenty three different routes. The financial plan is to\nbreak even over the course of the financial year with any profits made by the company covenanted to the charities\n{Hampton School and LEH), or deficits shared, on an equal basis. The Bursars of the two schools act as Directors and\nnominee shareholders. The books of account are maintained and audited on a separate basis and are not consolidated\ninto these accounts. Hampton School’s share of the results is shown in note 23.\n9.9 Reserves and Financial Health\nThe Governors believe that the School is in good financial health, with secure financial management and waiting lists\nfor prospective entrants to the Senior and Prep Schools stretching many years ahead. The current economic climate is\nbeing closely monitored and contingencies are in place should the economic conditions start to affect parents and cash\nflow. The Trust maintains an annual operating surplus which, supplemented by fund-raising, finances capital\nexpenditure on improving buildings, equipment and other necessary facilities. This enables the Charity to provide the\nfirst class education the parents, pupils and public have come to expect.\nThe Governors recognise that the level of reserves fluctuates and the School has invested substantial sums in the new\nSchool buildings in recent years. Adequate resources, including bank finance and unrestricted investment funds, are\navailable to provide a “safety net” should they be required.\nThe Governors regularly review the level and nature of the reserve funds of the School. The total value of School funds\nat 31 August 2016 was £32,058,546 of which unrestricted funds totalled £27,022,031, endowed funds £4,973,466 and\nrestricted funds £63,049. Within the investment portfolio are funds allocated for bursaries which, although designated,\nare unrestricted funds. The value of the Bursary fund at 31 August 2016 was £2,557,040 and this is available as\nunrestricted reserves for the School should the need arise. The funds are detailed in notes 15, 16 and 17.\nFree reserves are in line with Governors’ expectations.\n- The Governors aim to generate net income each year which will increase the reserves available.\n- The Property Reserves will be increased over time to equal the net amount invested in property.\n- ltisintended to continue to build and retain other funds as reserves when the Property Reserves are fully\nfunded.\n- Itis anticipated that the Fitzwygram Foundation (see note 24) will assist in the provision of bursaries at the\nSchool in the future.\n9.10 Appointment of auditors\nIn December 2015 the Governors re-appointed haysmacintyre as the School auditors for the financial year 2015 — 2016.\nThe Governors will consider a resolution proposing haysmacintyre as auditors for financial year 2016-2017.\n24\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n \n \n9.11 Statement of Governors’ Responsibilities\nThe Governors (who are the directors of Hampton School for the purposes of company law) are responsible for\npreparing the Governors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards).\nCompany law requires the Governors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the\nGovernors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted\nAccounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards) and applicable law.

In preparing these financial statements, the\nGovernors are required to:\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\nobserve the methods and principles in the Charities SORP;\nmake judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\nstate whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed subject to any material\ndepartures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\ne prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the School\nwill continue in business.\nThe Governors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the\nSchool’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the School and enable\nthem to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for\nsafeguarding the assets of the School and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud\nand other irregularities.\nSo far as each of the Governors is aware at the time the report is approved:\ne there is no relevant audit information of which the School's auditors are unaware; and\ne the Governors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit\ninformation and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.\n25\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS’ REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n10 PLANS FOR THE FUTURE\nFuture plans include the following:\ne Continue the establishment of an Alumni Relations department to enhance communication with former pupils,\nparents and staff\ne  Various projects are being considered, including:\no Improvement in the private study provision for the Sixth Form\no Continuation of the laboratory upgrade and grounds drainage programmes\nThis report, which incorporates the strategic report, is approved by the Board of Governors of Hampton School and\nsigned on its behalf by:\nN J Spooner BA\nChairman of the Governors\nDated: |LOECEMEEK 2014\n26\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF HAMPTON SCHOOL\n \nWe have audited the financial statements of Hampton School for the year ended 31 August 2016 which comprise the\nStatement of Financial Activities, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow Statement and the related notes.

The date of transition to FRS102 was 1\nSeptember 2014 and in preparing the financial statements, the Trustees have considered whether the accounting\npolicies required by the standard necessitate the restatement of comparative information. There have been no\nnumerical changes as a result of the transition to FRS 102, the reserves position is unadjusted from the previously\nreported position.\nThe accounts are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, as modified by the revaluation of\ninvestments.\nThe School is a Public Benefit Entity registered as a charity in England and Wales. Hampton School Foundation\nCharity became a charitable company, limited by guarantee, on 1 September 2007.\nGoing concern\nHaving reviewed the School’s future projected cash flows and the funding facilities available to the School\ntogether with the expected ongoing demand for places, the Governors have a reasonable expectation that the\nSchool has adequate resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and consider that there were\nno material uncertainties over the School’s financial viability. Accordingly, they also continue to adopt the going\nconcern basis in preparing the financial statements as outlined in the Statement of Accounting and Reporting\nResponsibilities on page 25.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the accounting policies, Governors are required to make judgement, estimates and\nassumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are\nconsidered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the\nperiod of the revision and future periods if the revision affected current and future periods.\nJudgements made by the Governors in the application of these policies that have significant effect on the financial\nstatements and estimates with a significant risk of material misstatement in the next year are deemed to be in\nrelation to the depreciation rates of tangible fixed assets and are discussed below.\nIn the view of the Governors, no assumptions concerning the future or estimation uncertainty affecting assets or\nliabilities at the balance sheet date are likely to result in a material adjustment to their carrying amounts in the\nnext financial year.\n32\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered\nmaterial in relation to the School’s financial statements.\nFees and similar earned income\nFees receivable and charges for services and use of the premises, less any allowances, scholarships, bursaries\ngranted by the School against those fees, but including contributions received from restricted funds, are\naccounted for in the period in which the service is provided.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income from dividends, bank balances and fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals\nbasis.\nDonations, legacies, grants and other voluntary income\nVoluntary income is accounted for as and when entitlement arises, the amount can be reliably quantified and the\neconomic benefit to the School is considered probable.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings on a direct cost basis.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nPension Schemes\nThe School contributes to the Teachers’ Pension Scheme and to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames\nPension Fund at rates set by their actuaries and advised to the school by their administrators. These are defined\nbenefit multi-employer pension schemes. For the former it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities of\nthe scheme that are attributable to the School and the School does not benefit from any surpluses on the scheme\nnor share in any losses. Accordingly, under FRS 102 the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined\ncontribution scheme. The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Pension Fund was closed to support staff\njoining the School after 1 April 2009. The School also contributes to The Pensions Trust Pension Scheme for\nsupport staff joining the School after 1 April 2009. This is a money purchase scheme with a current employer\ncontribution of 8% per annum and employee contribution of 4% per annum.\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames 2015 information has been restated where necessary to comply\nwith FRS 102.\nOperating Leases\nRentals payable are charged on a time basis over the lease term.\nRealised and unrealised gains/losses\nRealised gains/losses are recorded in the accounts at the date of disposal. Unrealised gains/losses are recorded at\nthe balance sheet date.\nAdvanced Fee Payments\nParents may enter into a contract with the School to pay tuition fees in advance and by doing so they receive a\ndiscount.\nAcceptance Deposits\nWhen parents choose not to send a pupil to the School after formally accepting a place the acceptance deposit is\nretained according to the School’s terms and conditions.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nBasic financial cost instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost with the exception of investments which are held at fair value. Financial assets held at amortised\ncost comprise cash at bank and in hand, together with trade and other debtors. A specific provision is made for\ndebts for which recoverability is in doubt. Cash at bank and in hand is defined as all cash held in instant access\nbank accounts and used as working capital. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise all creditors except\nsocial security and other taxes and provisions. Assets and liabilities held in foreign currency are translated to\nsterling at the balance sheet date at an appropriate exchange rate.\n34\nHAMPTON SCHOOL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016 2.  \nCHARITABLE ACTIVITIES - SCHOOL FEES RECEIVABLE\nThe School’s fee income comprises:\nGross fees\nLess bursaries, scholarships and staff discounts\nBursaries\nScholarships\nStaff discounts\n2016\n£\n25,142,756\n(2,788,211) 22,354,545\n1,589,948\n868,690\n329,573\n2,788,211\n2015\n£\n23,709,163\n(2,710,206)\n20,998,957 1,547,841\n800,123\n362,242\n2,710,206\nThe School awarded new scholarships to entrants who were judged to be of exceptional potential and re-awarded scholarships to pupils who already hold awards.

This success was very\npublicly recognised by the team from the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) which inspected the Schools in March\n2016. Its Report highlighted the very many excellent areas of the Schools' activities and particularly concluded for\nHampton School: ""The quality of the pupils' achievements in academic and co-curricular areas is exceptional"". It went\non to declare that the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, together with the quality of\ngovernance, is excellent. Such external recognition of the effectiveness of our approach is welcome but unsurprising\nin the light of the extraordinary range of talent and dedication exhibited by staff and pupils alike, driving the many\nactivities and results described in the Governors' Report below.\nA\nsignificant development for the Hampton School Trust, as signalled in my Report last year, has been the\nestablishment of the Fitzwygram Foundation, incorporated in March 2016. This associated charity has been set up\nwith the primary object of providing grant funding for the provision of bursaries to pupils and prospective pupils of the\nSchools. While the Foundation has not yet started fundraising, the Trust has nonetheless once more increased the\nvalue of bursaries awarded over the last year. The Fitzwygram Foundation is being developed in conjunction with an\never widening community of Hampton alumni who are keen to support the School in a variety of different ways.\nConcurrently the Hampton School community has been busy contributing to the Hampton Independent-State Schools\nPartnership (ISSP), a link between two independent schools (Hampton School and Lady Eleanor Holles [LEH]) and five\nmaintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames. The Hampton ISSP\nexists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools, and in doing so provides educational opportunities to\nthose from state-funded member schools which would not otherwise have been available to them. It has led to the\nsharing of many of Hampton School's facilities, including its sports infrastructure and The Hammond Theatre, all of\nwhich are also used regularly by both the local and wider communities.\nThe Trust's premises have been considerably enhanced by the completion, at the end of February 2016, of our\nmagnificent new Prep School building. The opening coincided with a change of name, from Denmead to Hampton Pre-\nPrep and Prep School, representing an exciting new phase in the life of the School and reflecting the closely\ncollaborative relationship with Hampton itself.\nAcademic results were again very impressive, with 91% of the grades awarded as A*-B at A Level. Of the 66 boys\nsitting the physics Pre-U exam, no fewer than 60 achieved the equivalent of an A* (D2) or above (D1). Almost all\nmembers of the Upper Sixth secured places at an elite university and 19 Oxbridge places were confirmed for 2016\nleavers. At GCSE the Schoo achieved another excellent set of results: 91% of the grades were A*-A, with a 99.83% A*-\nC pass rate.\nThe continuing success of Hampton's pupils in their many sporting activities is not limited to their playing for the\nSchool. Four of our cricketers were selected for national programmes and five were awarded outside club or County\ncolours. In football seven boys were selected to represent ISFA nationally and five for ISFA London. Three of our\nrowers won international colours for Great Britain, and twenty nine Hampton rugby players were selected for\ndevelopment groups or pathways with a range of major national clubs. A further two were awarded International\nColours (USA) and one signed a professional Rugby Sevens contract.\nWithin an extensive programme of performing arts over the year highlights included the musical ""Mack and Mabel"" in\nconjunction with Lady Eleanor Holles and the School Jazz Bands giving three concerts in Malta in July. Hampton's male\nvoice choir ""Voices of Lions"" reached the national selection stage at The Choir of the Year 2016 competition; they gave\neight concerts at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nFinally F can once again conclude this Chairman's Report by noting that the finances of the Hampton School Trust\nremain extremely robust. As in previous years we have produced a modest surplus to be re-invested back into ongoing\nimprovement of the School infrastructures. In spite of it being a time of some political and financial uncertainty our\nSchools are full and our lists of applicants continue to grow. It is not however a time for complacency. As Governors\nwe continue our dedication both to providing the best possible education for our pupils and to developing the means to\nincrease the access to the School for capable pupils whose financial circumstances would otherwise preclude them.\n1\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nHampton School Governors\nThe Governors are the charity trustees and directors of the company and have all served in office throughout the year\nexcept where indicated.\nDevelopment &\nRemuneration\nHampton Pre-\nGeneral\nFinance\n& Governor\nPrep & Prep\nBursary Fund\nCommittee\nSelection\nCommittee\nCommittee\nPurposes\nCommittee\nCommittee\nMr N J Spooner BA\n(Chairman of Governors)\nMr S A Bull BSc ACA\nChair\nMrs M Choueiri BA MBA\nMr R C Davison MA LRPS\n(To 22 Jun 16)\nMrs M-L Ellis Cert Ed\nMr R Kelly\nChair\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nHis Honour Judge S E Kramer MA QC (To 9 Dec 15)\nTo 9 Dec 15\nMr J A Livingston MA DIPL Arch RIBA (To 22 Jun 16)\nTo 22 Jun 16\nMr L R Llewellyn BSc MBA FCMA FRSA MMUS\nMrs R Mercer BA\n(From 9 Dec 15)\nMr A H Munday LLB QC\nChair\nMr S Naidu\nMr JJ S Perry BA\nChair\n(Vice Chairman)\nChair\nChair\nTo 22 Jun 16\nMr A J Roberts CBE BA FRSA FColl\nFrom 12 Sep 16\nAir-Vice Marshal G Skinner CBE BSc MSc CEng\nFIMechE FILT FRAeS RAF(Retd)\nMr R M Walker MA\nMr R J K Washington\nFrom 12 Sep 16\nTo 12 Sep 16\nMr L H Welch BArch (Hons) RIBA RIAS\n(From 22 Jun 16)\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nThe Reverend D N Winterburn BSc MA\nVicar of St Mary's Church, Hampton (To 12 Oct 16)\nMiss A V Yandle MA (Oxon)\n(From 14 Oct 15)\nHeadmaster:\nMr K Knibbs MA (Oxon)\nBursar, Clerk to the Governors and Company Secretary:\nMr M A King BSc\nThe Board of Governors of Hampton School is a self-appointing body with two exceptions: one is an Ex Officio Governor\nand shall be the Vicar of Ecclesiastical Parish of St Mary, Hampton and one nominated by the Old Hamptonians'\nAssociation, subject to the confirmation of the Governors.\nAddresses:\nHampton School\nHampton Pre-Prep & Prep School Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School\nHanworth Road\n41 - 43 Wensleydale Road\nGloucester Road\nHampton\nHampton\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nMiddlesex\nMiddlesex\nTW12 3HD\nTW12 2LP\nTW122 2UQ\nWebsites:\nwww.hamptonschool.org.uk\nwww.hamptonprep.org.uk\n2\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nBankers:\nBarclays Bank PLC\nCorporate Banking Centre\nOnslow Hall\nThe Little Green\nRichmond upon Thames\nSurrey\nTW9 1WB\nSolicitors:\nFarrer & Co\nVeale Wasbrough\nOrmerods\n66 Lincoln's Inn Fields\nNarrow Quay House\n45 Friends Road\nLondon\nNarrow Quay\nCroydon\nWC2A 3LH\nBristol\nCRO 1ED\nBS1 4QA\nAuditors:\nhaysmacintyre\n26 Red Lion Square\nLondon\nWC1R 4AG\nInsurance Brokers:\nMarsh Brokers Limited\nRockwood House\n1-5 Perrymount Road\nHaywards Heath\nWest Sussex\nRH16 3SY\nInvestment Advisers:\nGAM London Limited\n12 St James's Place\nLondon\nSW1A 1NX\nRegistered\nCharity No:\n1120005\nRegistered\nCompany No:\n06264434\nRegistered Address\nHampton School\nHanworth Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 3HD\n3\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nThe Governors present their annual report for the year ended 31 August 2016, together with the audited accounts for\nthe year.

The Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep and Bursary Fund Committees meet at least three times per\nyear and the Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee once per year. The Governors have continued to pay\nclose attention to their safeguarding obligations and those of the School community in general. The Governors monitor\nthe effectiveness of the Schools' safeguarding policies through the receipt, discussion and review of regular reports\nfrom the Schools' Safeguarding Lead and Officers and the nominated safeguarding Governors. There are currently two\nGovernors so nominated and they are available, whenever required, to advise and assist the Schools' Designated\nSafeguarding Lead and Officers in exercising the Schools' duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and\nyoung people.\nThe Chairs of the sub-committees are appointed at the first meeting every calendar year and the members are listed at\nthe start of this report.\n3.1 Governor Recruitment and Training\nThe Governing Body requires breadth and depth of experience to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently.

The Clerk to the Governors provides regular\ninformation on courses that may be helpful or relevant. Governors are encouraged to visit the Schools on a regular\nbasis.\nNo remuneration is paid to Governors.\n3.2 Organisational Management\nThe Governors determine the general policy of the schools. The day-to-day running of the Schools is delegated to the\nHeadmaster, supported by senior staff. The Headmaster and Bursar are invited to attend Governors' meetings.\nThe Governors' Remuneration & Governor Selection Committee meets annually in the Spring Term to consider the\nremuneration of Hampton School Trust senior staff (key management personnel), taking into account\nrecommendations put forward by the Headmaster.

This is intended\nto\nprovide an environment where each pupil can develop and fulfil his or her potential, thus helping to build self-\nconfidence and inculcating a desire to contribute to the wider community. Inextricably linked with this object is the aim\nof providing public benefit to the local, national and international community.\n4.3 These objects and aims are reflected by the ethos and aims stated in the Hampton School prospectus:\nEthos\nHampton is a friendly, lively and unpretentious school for boys\nThe School is a community where success is based upon achievement rather than the pursuit of narrowly\ndefined targets\nWe welcome academically minded pupils from both maintained and independent schools, irrespective of\nethnic group and background, and of their religious or non-religious beliefs\nWe encourage every boy to develop his full academic potentia and to develop skills for life through the wide\nrange of cultural, spiritual and sporting opportunities on offer\nWe believe that education is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills but about developing a spirit of\nintellectual enquiry in a caring, stimulating and enjoyable environment\nWe aspire to enable our boys not only to make sense of the world but also to want to go out and improve it\nAbove all, our aim is for those leaving Hampton to be open-minded, tolerant and full of conviction, to have a\nclear sense of right and wrong, and to aim for personal success while supporting those around them\nWe aim\nto attract and educate pupils\nof academic and all-round ambition\nfrom a wide range of schools\nto provide them with\na challenging and stimulating education\na friendly and supportive environment\nto develop in our pupils\nthe desire to achieve their full academic potential\na participative but critical approach to learning\na helpful and committed attitude to their School and the community\nrespect for self and others\ninvolvement in co-curricular activities\nskills for life at university and beyond\n6\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nWe attempt to achieve these aims through\na broad and balanced curriculum\nan established system of pastoral care\na co-operative and collaborative relationship with the community\nan extensive range of co-curricular activities\nthe development and maintenance of our site and its facilities\n5. ACCESS\nIt is important to the Governors that access to the education offered by Hampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep\nSchools is not restricted to those that can afford the fees and they are accessible to all, regardless of any disability.\nThey believe that children benefit from being taught within a diverse community since a great deal of learning occurs\nthrough social interaction, conversation and shared experiences. This learning promotes an understanding of other\npeoples' outlook and is an important training for adult life.\nThe bursary policy, accessibility plan and teaching links programme contribute to a widening of access to the education\nthe two Schools offer and the facilities they enjoy.\n5.1 Scholarships and Bursaries\nWhile the Governors view the bursary and scholarship awards as a means of ensuring a good school environment\ndrawing from all faiths, backgrounds and parts of the community, they are nonetheless aware in funding them of the\nneed for fairness between fee paying parents, many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to pay for their\nchild(ren)'s education, and those benefiting from the awards. They are also responsible for ensuring the on-going\nfinancial sustainability of the Schools, which do not have a large endowment, and aware of the need to develop their\nfacilities to remain attractive in a competitive market.\nThe Governors' policy is to award scholarships on the basis of an individual's educational and co-curricular merit or\npotential, subject to any conditions imposed for particular awards by the original donor. They also offer bursary\nscholarships where the scholarship is supplemented by a bursary.\nBursary awards, which are available to all who meet the Schools' general entry requirements, are made solely on the\nbasis of parental means or to relieve hardship (for example in the case of redundancy) and where a student's education\nand future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Bursary awards are given up to 100% fees discount. Free Places are\nalso offered with 100% fees discount along with assistance in meeting uniform, exam and lunch costs and other\nreasonable costs including those of some educational trips. In assessing means many factors are taken into account,\nincluding family income, investments, savings and other assets, and other considerations such as the number of siblings\nand dependent relatives.\nInformation regarding bursaries is supplied in the Parent's Guide to all those applying to the Schools. Free Places are\nadvertised in the local newspaper and directly to loca state primary schools.\nThe Schools attract high quality teaching and non-teaching staff through fee remissions for their children, if they meet\nthe academic admissions requirements.\nThis year the total value of awards was f2,788,211 (2015: f2,710,206) with 376 awards made as detailed in note 2 to\nthe accounts (2015:374). Bursaries totalling E1,589,948 (2015: f1,547,841) were awarded and the Governors' are\nseeking ways to increase the level of bursary funding. There were 58 pupils on a 100% Bursary or Free Places. The value\nof scholarships totalled E868,690 (2015:6800,123). Staff discounts amounted to f329,573 (2015:f362,242).\n7\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n5.2 Teaching Links and community access\nHampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Schools are part of a wider community within which they are keen to\nparticipate.

The Hampton Lions Alumni Office supports Hamptonians after they have left School and throughout their\ncareers and beyond. It encourages and enables former pupils to keep in touch with each other and with the School.\nStrong links between the School and its alumni community are a continuing source of mutual benefit. Old Hamptonians\noften return to the School as speakers, for example at the annual Careers Evening. A number of Old Hamptonians have\nsons who are currently pupils at the School. The School regularly receives reports of past pupils, for example when they\ngraduate from their universities or achieve successes in business, sporting, cultural or other spheres.\n6.2.3 Clubs, Societies and Co-curricular Activities\nThe School continues to provide an extensive programme of co-curricular activities both within the School and in the\nwider community.

We value thinking of others first, as well as not giving up. Our academic programme is\nbroad and balanced. Results do matter here, as they should, but meaningfu progress matters too; the pleasure of\nknowing you have tried your best and have been recognised for that is a feeling that ought to inspire and endure long\nafter our days at prep school are over. We believe this is a critically important function of our role in terms of preparing\nall our pupils for successful transfer to a senior school that will be the best fit for them.\nFebruary, 2016 saw the Prep pupils and staff occupy our magnificent, new building. This momentous event was the\nculmination of many years of hard work and dedication from a great range of stakeholders and it cannot be stated\nenough what an incredible impact this event has had on the life of the School. We also changed our name from\nDenmead to Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep, to better reflect the close and collaborative nature of the relationship we enjoy\nwith Hampton School.\nInvolvement by all pupils in the extensive co-curricular programme of the School is a fundamental aspect of their time\nhere. Regardless of ability in sport or the arts, children are enthusiastically encouraged to participate to the best of\ntheir ability. The extensive games programme provides many opportunities to represent the School and performing\narts productions are ambitious and imaginative. The residential trips undertaken by Years 3 to 6 not only provide a\nbreath-taking array of activities for them to try, but also valuable lessons in citizenship.\nSuccessful personal relationships sit at the heart of any successful community. We want our pupils to be confident and\nkind, happy, considerate and well-mannered. It is a source of great joy to see these qualities, in every child, flourish.\n15\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n6.3.2 Admissions and Pupil Numbers\nCurrently the School is full from Years 1 - 6, with the Kindergarten and Reception Year groups close to full.

This new\nformat worked extremely well and we managed more than satisfactorily with the greatly increased numbers of\nprospective parents who visited us on this occasion. Close to 100 families visited the Pre-Prep & Prep. Interest in places\nfor all Year groups continues to grow. In November 2016 we will be holding a further Open Morning plus our 7+\nAssessment Morning for pupils seeking a place in Year 3, September 2017.\n.3.3Developments and Maintenance\nThe construction of the new Prep building on the Gloucester Road was completed in time for occupation at the\nbeginning of the summer 2016 term.\n6.4 Fundraising performance\nThere were no material fundraising activities in the year.\n16\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n7 PUBLIC BENEFIT\nHampton School has always taken and will continue to take its responsibilities as a charitable trust very seriously. The\nSchool will continue to contribute a great deal to the community. It will, with reference to the Charities Act 2006:\n1.\nmaintain and enhance its impressive list of public benefit activities;\n2.\nseek to raise new funds devoted to means-tested entry bursaries and by transferring funds from non-means-\ntested awards; and\n3. provide more means-tested Free Places.\nThe staff and pupils of the School continue to commit a great deal of time and effort to providing a wide range of public\nbenefit locally, nationally and internationally. A detailed list of Hampton School's Public Benefit work may be found on\nthe School's website, some examples of their activities are shown below. It is a great tribute to the ethos of the School\nthat our pupils are so willing to support So many activities.\nHampton School has registered on the ISC Schools Together website and has uploaded examples of projects, including\nmathematics support for Reach Academy students and lunchtime sport and co-curricular support for locally based\nClarendon School.\nThe Hampton Independent-State Schools Partnership (ISSP) is a link between two independent schools (Hampton\nSchool and Lady Eleanor Holles [LEH]) and five maintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and\nKingston upon Thames (Orleans Park School, Hampton High, Tolworth Girls' School, Teddington School and Hollyfield\nSchool).\nThe Hampton ISSP exists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools listed above. Over time, we have\ntogether built up a lively and varied programme of educational and co-curricular opportunities, alongside the provision\nof academic support throughout the year. This has enabled pupils and teachers across the partnership to work\ncollaboratively and to draw upon the particular strengths of each school. All schools within the Hampton ISSP are\ninvited to host events across the year, during which pupils join together for activities including the following:\nMathematics, IT, Science, Design & Technology, Public Speaking, Dance, Music, and a Model United Nations\nConference.\nFor many years, the Hampton ISSP schools have supported each other with GCSE revision sessions run at weekends\nacross a range of subjects, resulting in an improvement in the final grades awarded. Pupils from the state-funded\nmember schools have been able to enjoy educational opportunities which would not otherwise have been available to\nthem, such as courses in A Level Further Mathematics. We have also been delighted to see 43 Year 8 pupils from our\nstate-funded partners enrol recently in the second iteration of a three-year Latin course run by two members of\nHampton School's Classics Department.\nThe Hampton ISSP has also led to the sharing of many of Hampton School's facilities by schools within the partnership:\nHampton School's sports facilities are used regularly by one of the schools within the partnership and joint theatre\nproductions take place on a regular basis in Hampton's Hammond Theatre.\nAs a charity the parents of our pupils have the assurance that all the income of the School must be applied for\neducational purposes. As an educational charity we enjoy tax exemption on our educational activities and on our\ninvestment income and gains provided these are applied for our charitable aims. We are entitled to an 80% reduction\non our business rates on the property we occupy for our charitable purposes. The financial benefits we receive from\nthis tax exemption are all applied for educational purposes and indirectly help us to maintain our bursary policy and our\npartnerships programme with maintained schools.

Detailed considerations of risk are\ndelegated to the Senior Management of the Schools apart from those relating to the Board and its membership. Risks\nare identified and assessed and controls are established throughout the year. A formal written review of the Charity's\nrisk management processes is undertaken on an annual basis.\nThis review covers the major risks and uncertainties common to all independent schools (for example, maintenance of\nhigh quality teaching staff; attraction of planned for pupil numbers; effective and controlled funding for\ndevelopment;\nsafeguarding; development of increasing public benefit) but also includes any more immediate, specific and shorter\nterm uncertainties\nThrough such reviews and the overall risk management processes established for the Schools, the Governors are\nsatisfied that the principal risks identified have been adequately mitigated where possible. It is recognised that systems\ncan only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that major risks have been adequately managed.\nThe principal risks currently identified ion the School's risk register are:\nRisk\nMitigation\nEffectiveness of the safeguarding policy and\nAppointment of Designated Safeguarding Lead & Officers, nominating\nprocedures including the ""Prevent"" duty\nGovernors with lead safeguarding responsibility and routine reporting\nat Board meetings\nRecruitment and retention of staff\nCompetitive salary and benefits including consideration to provide\naccommodation\nCompliance with the Public Benefit test\nExtensive discussion, preparation and planning.\nMonitoring and recording of the Public Benefits provided\nICT systems not fit for purpose\nAssessment of ICT systems by an external consultant and\nimplementation of their recommendations\nData loss or data protection infringement\nRobust policies, regular system backup and encryption of laptops\nThe Governors had previously identified the standard of accommodation at the Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Gloucester\nRoad site as a principal risk.

Hampton\nSchool has responsibility for the maintenance of the site and LEH for all financial operations. For ease of administration\nthe complete revenue and costs are recorded in the accounts of LEH and audited as part of its accounts. A yearly\nreconciliation takes place thus ensuring income and expenditure is evenly shared and recorded in the respective\naccounts.\n9.8.2 Pupilcoach Limited\nPupilCoach Limited is a joint trading company wholly owned in equal shares by Hampton School and LEH. The company\nprovides a service to parents requiring help in transporting their children to and from school.\nThe licensed coaches currently carry over 1,100 pupils a day on twenty three different routes. The financial plan is to\nbreak even over the course of the financial year with any profits made by the company covenanted to the charities\n(Hampton School and LEH), or deficits shared, on an equal basis. The Bursars of the two schools act as Directors and\nnominee shareholders The books of account are maintained and audited on a separate basis and are not consolidated\ninto these accounts. Hampton School's share of the results is shown in note 23.\n9.9 Reserves and Financial Health\nThe Governors believe that the School is in good financial health, with secure financial management and waiting lists\nfor prospective entrants to the Senior and Prep Schools stretching many years ahead. The current economic climate is\nbeing closely monitored and contingencies are in place should the economic conditions start to affect parents and cash\nflow. The Trust maintains an annual operating surplus which, supplemented by fund-raising, finances capital\nexpenditure on improving buildings, equipment and other necessary facilities. This enables the Charity to provide the\nfirst class education the parents, pupils and public have come to expect.\nThe Governors recognise that the level of reserves fluctuates and the School has invested substantial sums in the new\nSchool buildings in recent years. Adequate resources, including bank finance and unrestricted investment funds, are\navailable to provide a ""safety net"" should they be required.\nThe Governors regularly review the level and nature of the reserve funds of the School. The total value of School funds\nat 31 August 2016 was f32,058,546 of which unrestricted funds totalled f27,022,031, endowed funds f4,973,466 and\nrestricted funds f63,049.

The value of the Bursary fund at 31 August 2016 was f2,557,040 and this is available as\nunrestricted reserves for the School should the need arise. The funds are detailed in notes 15, 16 and 17.\nFree reserves are in line with Governors' expectations.\nThe Governors aim to generate net income each year which will increase the reserves available.\nThe Property Reserves will be increased over time to equal the net amount invested in property.\nIt is intended to continue to build and retain other funds as reserves when the Property Reserves are fully\nfunded.\nIt is anticipated that the Fitzwygram Foundation (see note 24) will assist in the provision of bursaries at the\nSchool in the future.\n9.10 Appointment of auditors\nIn December 2015 the Governors re-appointed haysmacintyre as the School auditors for the financial year 2015 - 2016.\nThe Governors will consider a resolution proposing haysmacintyre as auditors for financial year 2016-2017.\n24\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n9.11 Statement of Governors' Responsibilities\nThe Governors (who are the directors of Hampton School for the purposes of company law) are responsible for\npreparing the Governors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards).\nCompany law requires the Governors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.

in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in\nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102), the Companies Act 2006 and the Statement of Recommended Practice\napplicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in\nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS S102) - effective 1 January 2015. The date of transition to FRS102 was 1\nSeptember 2014 and in preparing the financial statements, the Trustees have considered whether the accounting\npolicies required by the standard necessitate the restatement of comparative information. There have been no\nnumerical changes as a result of the transition to FRS 102, the reserves position is unadjusted from the previously\nreported position.\nThe accounts are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, as modified by the revaluation of\ninvestments.\nThe School is a Public Benefit Entity registered as a charity in England and Wales. Hampton School Foundation\nCharity became a charitable company, limited by guarantee, on 1 September 2007.\nGoing concern\nHaving reviewed the School's future projected cash flows and the funding facilities available to the School\ntogether with the expected ongoing demand for places, the Governors have a reasonable expectation that the\nSchool has adequate resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and consider that there were\nno material uncertainties over the School's financial viability. Accordingly, they also continue to adopt the going\nconcern basis in preparing the financial statements as outlined in the Statement of Accounting and Reporting\nResponsibilities on page 25.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the accounting policies, Governors are required to make judgement, estimates and\nassumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are\nconsidered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the\nperiod of the revision and future periods if the revision affected current and future periods.\nJudgements made by the Governors in the application of these policies that have significant effect on the financial\nstatements and estimates with a significant risk of material misstatement in the next year are deemed to be in\nrelation to the depreciation rates of tangible fixed assets and are discussed below.\nIn the view of the Governors, no assumptions concerning the future or estimation uncertainty affecting assets or\nliabilities at the balance sheet date are likely to result in a material adjustment to their carrying amounts in the\nnext financial year.\n32\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered\nmaterial in relation to the School's financial statements.\nFees and similar earned income\nFees receivable and charges for services and use of the premises, less any allowances, scholarships, bursaries\ngranted by the School against those fees, but including contributions received from restricted funds, are\naccounted for in the period in which the service is provided.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income from dividends, bank balances and fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals\nbasis.\nDonations, legacies, grants and other voluntary income\nVoluntary income is accounted for as and when entitlement arises, the amount can be reliably quantified and the\neconomic benefit to the School is considered probable.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings on a direct cost basis. The irrecoverable element of VAT is included\nwith the item of expense to which it relates. Any expenses incurred with recoverable VAT are shown net of VAT.\nTangible fixed assets and depreciation\nItems purchased with a cost of greater than f5,000 are depreciated. Depreciation is provided at the following\nannual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful economic life.\nFurniture, fixtures & fittings, office equipment\n15% on cost\nKitchen, administrative and teaching equipment\n15% on cost\nMotorised equipment\n20% on cost\nComputer equipment\n50% on cost\nSecurity & control systems\n33.3% on cost\nProperty improvements\n10% on cost\nMotor vehicles\n25% on cost\nRowing boats\n10% on cost\nFreehold property\n2% on cost with 10% residual value\nLeasehold property\n2% on cost with 10% residual value or term of\nlease if shorter\nAnnual impairment reviews are carried out.\nWhere assets are fully depreciated by the balance sheet date they are eliminated from the accounts in the\nfollowing year.\nFund accounting\nUnrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the Governors in furtherance of the general\nobjectives of the Charity.\nDesignated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the Governors for particular purposes.\nRestricted funds are subject to restrictions on their expenditure imposed by the donor.\nEndowment funds are held permanently and are represented by investments and certain property.\n33\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nPension Schemes\nThe School contributes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme and to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames\nPension Fund at rates set by their actuaries and advised to the school by their administrators. These are defined\nbenefit multi-employer pension schemes. For the former it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities of\nthe scheme that are attributable to the School and the School does not benefit from any surpluses on the scheme\nnor share in any losses. Accordingly, under FRS 102 the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined\ncontribution scheme. The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Pension Fund was closed to support staff\njoining the School after 1 April 2009. The School also contributes to The Pensions Trust Pension Scheme for\nsupport staff joining the School after 1 April 2009. This is a money purchase scheme with a current employer\ncontribution of 8% per annum and employee contribution of 4% per annum.\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames 2015 information has been restated where necessary to comply\nwith FRS 102.\nOperating Leases\nRentals payable are charged on a time basis over the lease term.\nRealised and unrealised gains/losses\nRealised gains/losses are recorded in the accounts at the date of disposal. Unrealised gains/losses are recorded at\nthe balance sheet date.\nAdvanced Fee Payments\nParents may enter into a contract with the School to pay tuition fees in advance and by doing So they receive a\ndiscount.\nAcceptance Deposits\nWhen parents choose not to send a pupil to the School after formally accepting a place the acceptance deposit is\nretained according to the School's terms and conditions.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nBasic financial cost instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost with the exception of investments which are held at fair value. Financial assets held at amortised\ncost comprise cash at bank and in hand, together with trade and other debtors. A specific provision is made for\ndebts for which recoverability is in doubt. Cash at bank and in hand is defined as all cash held in instant access\nbank accounts and used as working capital. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise all creditors except\nsocial security and other taxes and provisions. Assets and liabilities held in foreign currency are translated to\nsterling at the balance sheet date at an appropriate exchange rate.\n34\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n2.\nCHARITABLE ACTIVITIES - SCHOOL FEES RECEIVABLE\n2016\n2015\nE\nE\nThe School's fee income comprises:\nGross fees\n25,142,756\n23,709,163\nLess bursaries, scholarships and staff discounts\n(2,788,211)\n(2,710,206)\n22,354,545\n20,998,957\nBursaries\n1,589,948\n1,547,841\nScholarships\n868,690\n800,123\nStaff discounts\n329,573\n362,242\n2,788,211\n2,710,206\nThe School awarded new scholarships to entrants who were judged to be of exceptional potential and re-awarded\nscholarships to pupils who already hold awards.

This success was very\npublicly recognised by the team from the Independent Schools Inspectorate {ISI) which inspected the Schools in March\n2016. Its Report highlighted the very many excellent areas of the Schools' activities and particularly concluded for\nHampton School: 'The quality ofthe pupils' achievements in academic and eo-curricular areas is exceptional"". lt went\non to declare that the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, together with the quality of\ngovernance, is excellent. Such external recognition of the effectiveness of our approach is welcome but unsurprising\nin the light of the extraordinary range of talent and dedication exhibited by staff and pupils alike, driving the many\nactivities and results described in the Governors' Report below.\nA significant development for the Hampton School Trust, as signalled in my Report last year, has been the\nestablishment of the Fitzwygram Foundation, incorporated in March 2016 . This associated charity has been set up\nwith the primary object of providing grant funding for the provision of bursaries to pupils and prospective pupils of the\nSchools. While the Foundation has not yet started fundraising, the Trust has nonetheless once more increased the\nvalue of bursaries awarded over the last year. The Fitzwygram Foundation is being developed in conjunction with an\never widening community of Hampton alumni who are keen to support the School in a variety of different ways.\nConcurrently the Hampton School community has been busy contributing to the Hampton Independent-State Schools\nPartnership {ISSP), a link between two independent schools {Hampton School and lady Eleanor Holies [LEH]) and five\nmaintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames . The Hampton ISSP\nexists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools, and in doing so provides educational opportunities to\nthose from state-funded member schools which would not otherwise have been available to them. lt has led to the\nsharing of many of Hampton School's facilities, including its sports infrastructure and The Hammond Theatre, all of\nwhich are also used regularly by both the local and wider communities.\nThe Trust's premises have been considerably enhanced by the completion, at the end of February 2016, of our\nmagnificent new Prep School building. The opening coincided with a change of name, from Den mead to Hampton Pre-\nPrep and Prep School, representing an exciting new phase in the life of the School and reflecting the closely\ncollaborative relationship with Hampton itself.\nAcademic results were again very impressive, with 91% of the grades awarded as A*-Bat A Level. Of the 66 boys\nsitting the physics Pre-U exam, no fewer than 60 achieved the equivalent of an A* (02) or above (01) . Almost all\nmembers of the Upper Sixth secured places at an elite university and 19 Oxbridge places were confirmed for 2016\nleavers . At GCSE the School achieved another excellent set of results: 91% of the grades were A*-A, with a 99.83% A*-\nC pass rate.\nThe continuing success of Hampton's pupils in their many sporting activities is not limited to their playing for the\nSchool. Four of our cricketers were selected for national programmes and five were awarded outside club or County\ncolours. In football seven boys were selected to represent ISFA nationally and five for ISFA London. Three of our\nrowers won international colours for Great Britain, and twenty nine Hampton rugby players were selected for\ndevelopment groups or pathways with a range of major national clubs. A further two were awarded International\nColours (USA) and one signed a professional Rugby Sevens contract.\nWithin an extensive programme of performing arts over the year highlights included the musicai""Mack and M abel"" in\nconjunction with lady Eleanor Holies and the School Jazz Bands giving three concerts in Malta in July. Hampton's male\nvoice choir ""Voices of lions"" reached the national selection stage at The Choir of the Year 2016 competition; they gave\neight concerts at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nFinally I can once again conclude this Chairman's Report by noting that the finances of the Hampton School Trust\nremain extremely robust. As in previous years we have produced a modest surplus to be re-invested back into ongoing\nimprovement of the School infrastructures. In spite of it being a time of some political and financial uncertainty our\nSchools are full and our lists of applicants continue to grow. lt is not however a time for complacency. As Governors\nwe continue our dedication both to providing the best possible education for our pupils and to developing the means to\nincrease the access to the School for capable pupils whose financial circumstances would otherwise preclude them.\n1\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nHampton School Governors\nThe Governors are the charity trustees and directors of the company and have all served in office throughout the year\nexcept where indicated .\n··-\nDevelopment &\nRemuneration\nHampton Pre-\nPrep & Prep\nGeneral\nFinance\n& Governor\nBursary Fund\nCommittee\nPurposes\nCommittee\nSelection\nCommittee\n~rNJ ~pooner BA\n{Chairman of Governors) j\nIMr SA Bull BSc ACA\n_j\nMrs M Choueiri BA MBA\nI\nIMr RC Davison MA LRPS\n(To22Jun16} I\n[ Mrs M-L Ellis Cert Ed\n~ .,/'\nMr R Kelly\nI Chair\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nHis Honour Judge S E Kramer MA QC (To 9 Dec 15} I\nMr J A Livingston MA DIPL Arch RI BA (To 22 Jun 16}\nMr L R Llewellyn BSc MBA FCMA FRSA MMUS\nMrs R Mercer BA\n{From 9 Dec 15}\nMrAHMundayLLBQC\n.,/ '\nMr S Naidu\n.,/ '\nMrJSPerryBA\n{Vice Chairman)\nChair\nTo22Jun16\nMr A J Roberts CBE BA FRSA FColl\nAir-Vice Marshal G Skinner CBE BSc MSc CEng\nFIMechE FILT FRAeS RAF(Retd)\nMrRM WalkerMA\nMr R J K Washington\n., /'\nFrom 12 Sep 16\nMr L H Welch BArch (Hons) RI BA RIAS\n(From 22 Jun 16}\nThe Reverend D N Winterburn BSc MA\nVicar of St Mary's Church, Hampton (To 12 Oct 16}\nMiss A V Yandle MA (Oxon)\n(From 14 Oct 15}\nHeadmaster:\nBursar, Clerk to the Governors and Company Secretary:\nComm ittee\nCommittee\n., /'\n. ,/'\nChair\n.,/ '\n---------\nI.,/'j\n.,/'\nr-----\n.,/'---1\n. ,/'\n...\nTo9Dec 15\n., /'\nTo22Jun 16\nChair\n. ,/'\n., /'\n., /'\nChair\n. ,/'\n., /'\nFrom 12 Sep 16\n. ,/'\nTo12Sep16\n., /'\nFrom 22 Jun 16\nI\nMr K Knibbs MA (Oxon)\nMrMAKingBSc\nThe Board of Governors of Hampton School is a self-appoi nting body with two exceptions: one is an Ex Officio Governor\nand shall be the Vicar of Ecclesiastical Parish of St Mary, Hampton and one nominated by t he Old Hamptonians'\nAssoci ation, subject to the confirmation of the Governors.\nAddresses:\nWebsites:\nHampton School\nHanworth Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 3HD\nHampton Pre-Prep & Prep School Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School\n41 - 43 Wensleydale Road\nGloucester Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 2LP\nwww.hamptonschool .org.uk\nwww.hamptonprep.org.uk\n2\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW12 2UQ\n., /'\n., /'\n., /'\n., /'\nChair\n., /'\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nBankers:\nSolicitors:\nAuditors:\nInsurance Brokers:\nInvestment Advisers:\nRegistered\nCharity No:\nRegistered\nCompany No:\nRegistered Address\nBarclays Bank PLC\nCorporate Banking Centre\nOnslow Hall\nThe Little Green\nRichmond upon Thames\nSurrey\nTW91WB\nFarrer & Co\n66 Lincoln's Inn Fields\nLondon\nWC2A3LH\nhaysmacintyre\n26 Red Lion Square\nLondon\nWC1R4AG\nMarsh Brokers Limited\nRockwood House\n1-5 Perrymount Road\nHaywards Heath\nWest Sussex\nRH16 3SV\nGAM London Limited\n12 St James's Place\nLondon\nSWlA lNX\n1120005\n06264434\nHampton School\nHanworth Road\nHampton\nMiddlesex\nTW123HD\n3\nVeale Wasbrough\nNarrow Quay House\nNarrow Quay\nBristol\nBS14QA\nOrmerods\n45 Friends Road\nCroydon\nCRO lED\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nThe Governors present their annual report for the year ended 31 August 2016, together with the audited accounts for\nthe year.

CONSTITUTION\nHampton School is a charitable company limited by guarantee. lt incorporates and runs two schools, Hampton School\nand Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School. Both Schools have the same Department for Education number, 318/6071. The\nSchools are governed by the same Governing Body. The accounts of Hampton School Trust are amalgamated with\nthose of the company; following an order made by the Charity Commission on 17 August 2007, under charity number\n1120005.\n2. GOVERNING INSTRUMENT\nThe Company is governed by its Memorandum of Association dated 14 May 2007 and Articles of Association dated 28\nNovember 2007. Governors are also guided by the Scheme of Management and Delegation which includes Terms of\nReference for the sub-committees :\nThe Finance Committee\nThe Development and General Purposes Committee\nThe Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee\nThe Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Committee\nThe Bursary Fund Committee\n3. GOVERNANCE\nThe Governors are required to be members of the Company and are also Trustees and Directors. Governors are\nresponsible for the overall management and control of Hampton School and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep School and they\nusually meet at least four times a year. The work of implementing most of their policies is carried out by the members\nof the Development and General Purpose Committee and the Finance Committee which meet before each meeting of\nthe full Governing Board . The Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep and Bursary Fund Committees meet at least three times per\nyear and the Remuneration and Governor Selection Committee once per year. The Governors have continued to pay\nclose attention to their safeguarding obligations and those of the School community in general. The Governors monitor\nthe effectiveness of the Schools' safeguarding policies through the receipt, discussion and review of regular reports\nfrom the Schools' Safeguarding Lead and Officers and the nominated safeguarding Governors. There are currently two\nGovernors so nominated and they are available, whenever required, to advise and assist the Schools' Designated\nSafeguarding Lead and Officers in exercising the Schools' duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and\nyoung people.\nThe Chairs of the sub-committees are appointed at the first meeting every calendar year and the members are listed at\nthe start of this report.\n3.1 Governor Recruitment and Training\nThe Governing Body requires breadth and depth of experience to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently. Where\npossible the composition should comprise the following:\n4\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n•\nA Governor with a legal background\n•\nA Governor with a financial I accounting background\n•\nA Governor with education experience\n•\nA Governor with senior managerial or business experience\n•\nA Governor with experience of equal opportunities and disability needs\n•\nAt least one female Governor and at least one male Governor\nOne Governor may meet one or more of these requirements.\nThe process of appointment is:\n•\nA potential Governor is nominated subject to the criteria laid down by the Remuneration and Governor\nSelection Committee\n•\nDiscussions about the nomination take place with the Chairman of Governors, Headmaster and Clerk to the\nGovernors\n•\nIf a potential Governor is identified as having specific required skills his/her CV is submitted to all Governors for\nprovisional approval\n•\nThe potential Governor usually meets the Governors informally prior to a Governors' meeting and visits the\nSchools and meets senior staff\n•\nSubject to final Governors' approval the Governor is selected\nFollowing appointment, a comprehensive information pack including past Governors' minutes, accounts, the Charitable\nScheme and details of the role of a Trustee is given to the new Governor. The Clerk to the Governors provides regular\ninformation on courses that may be helpful or relevant. Governors are encouraged to visit the Schools on a regular\nbasis.\nNo remuneration is paid to Governors.\n3.2 Organisational Management\nThe Governors determine the general policy of the schools. The day-to-day running of the Schools is delegated to the\nHeadmaster, supported by senior staff. The Headmaster and Bursar are invited to attend Governors' meetings.\nThe Governors' Remuneration & Governor Selection Committee meets annually in the Spring Term to consider the\nremuneration of Hampton School Trust senior staff (key management personnel), taking into account\nrecommendations put forward by the Headmaster. The Committee recommends remuneration levels which are\nratified by the Governors at their meeting at the end of the Spring Term. Once ratified, senior staff remuneration levels\nare communicated to them by the Headmaster and Bursar as appropriate. The Headmaster's remuneration is reviewed\nseparately on an annual basis by the Chairman of the Governors in consultation with the Remuneration & Governor\nSelection Committee.\n4. OBJECTS AND AIMS\n4.1 Objects\nThe object of the Charity is to advance the education of boys and girls and in particular (but not limited to) running a\nday and/or boarding school or schools in or near Hampton and by ancillary or incidental educational activities and other\nassociated activities for the benefit of the community.\n5\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n4.2Aims\nThe Charity provides education to boys from the ages of 2Y.- 18 and girls 2Y. - 7 in its two schools, Hampton School and\nHampton Pre -Prep & Prep School.\nIn accordance with the objects, these schools aim to provide a first class independent education both through strong\nacademic tuition and through deve loping the wider sporting, artistic and social skills of their pupils. This is intended to\nprovide an environment where each pupil can develop and fulfil his or her potential, thus helping to build self-\nconfidence and inculcating a desire to contribute to the wider community. Inextricably linked with this object is the aim\nof providing public benefit to the local, national and international community.\n4.3 These objects and aims are reflected by the ethos and aims stated in the Hampton School prospectus:\nEthos\n•\nHampton is a friendly, lively and unpret entious school for boys\n•\nThe School is a community where success is based upon achievement rather than the pursuit of narrowly\ndefined targets\n•\nWe welcome academically minded pupils from both maintained and independent schools, irrespective of\nethnic group and background, and of their religious or non-religious beliefs\n•\nWe encourage every boy to develop his full academic potential and to develop skills for life through the wide\nrange of cultural, spiritual and sporting opportunities on offer\n•\nWe believe that education is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills but about developing a spirit of\nintellectual enquiry in a caring, stimulating and enjoyable environment\n•\nWe aspire to enable our boys not only to make sense of the world but also to want to go out and improve it\n•\nAbove all, our aim is for those leaving Hampton to be open-minded, tolerant and full of conviction, to have a\nclear sense of right and wrong, and to aim for personal success while supporting those around them\nWe aim\nto attract and educate pupils\n•\nof academic and all-round ambition\n•\nfrom a wide range of schools\nto provide them with\n•\na challenging and stimulating education\n•\na friendly and supportive environment\nto develop in our pupils\n•\nthe desire to achieve their full academic potential\n•\na participative but critical approach to learning\n•\na helpful and committed attitude to their School and the community\n•\nrespect for self and others\n•\ninvolvement in eo-curricular activities\n•\nskills for life at university and beyond\n6\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nWe attempt to achieve these aims through\n•\na broad and balanced curriculum\n•\nan established system of pastoral care\n•\na co-operative and collaborative relationship with the community\n•\nan extensive range of eo-curricular activities\n•\nthe development and maintenance of our site and its facilities\n5. ACCESS\nlt is important to the Governors that access to the education offered by Hampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep\nSchools is not restricted to those that can afford the fees and they are accessible to all, regardless of any disability.\nThey believe that children benefit from being taught within a diverse community since a great deal of learning occurs\nthrough social interaction, conversation and shared experiences. This learning promotes an understanding of other\npeoples' outlook and is an important training for adult life.\nThe bursary policy, accessibility plan and teaching links programme contribute to a widening of access to the education\nthe two Schools offer and the facilities they enjoy.\n5.1 Scholarships and Bursaries\nWhile the Governors view the bursary and scholarship awards as a means of ensuring a good school environment\ndrawing from all faiths, backgrounds and parts of the community, they are nonetheless aware in funding them of the\nneed for fairness between fee paying parents, many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to pay for their\nchild(ren)'s education, and those benefiting from the awards. They are also responsible for ensuring the on-going\nfinancial sustainability of the Schools, which do not have a large endowment, and aware of the need to develop their\nfacilities to remain attractive in a competitive market.\nThe Governors' policy is to award scholarships on the basis of an individual's educational and eo-curricular merit or\npotential, subject to any conditions imposed for particular awards by the original donor. They also offer bursary\nscholarships where the scholarship is supplemented by a bursary.\nBursary awards, which are available to all who meet the Schools' general entry requirements, are made solely on the\nbasis of parental means or to relieve hardship (for example in the case of redundancy) and where a student's education\nand future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Bursary awards are given up to 100% fees discount. Free Places are\nalso offered with 100% fees discount along with assistance in meeting uniform, exam and lunch costs and other\nreasonable costs including those of some educational trips. In assessing means many factors are taken into account,\nincluding family income, investments, savings and other assets, and other considerations such as the number of siblings\nand dependent relatives.\nInformation regarding bursaries is supplied in the Parent's Guide to all those applying to the Schools. Free Places are\nadvertised in the local newspaper and directly to local state primary schools.\nThe Schools attract high quality teaching and non-teaching staff through fee remissions for their children, if they meet\nthe academic admissions requirements.\nThis year the total value of awards was £2,788,211 (2015: £2,710,206) with 376 awards made as detailed in note 2 to\nthe accounts (2015:374). Bursaries totalling £1,589,948 (2015: £1,547,841) were awarded and the Governors' are\nseeking ways to increase the level of bursary funding. There were 58 pupils on a 100% Bursary or Free Places. The value\nof scholarships totalled £868,690 (2015:£800,123). Staff discounts amounted to £329,573 (2015:£362,242).\n7\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n5.2 Teaching Links and community access\nHampton and Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Schools are part of a wider commun ity within which they are keen to\nparticipate. The Schools are ab le and want to support broader educational activities to the benefit of other children and\ntheir teachers. Examples are given below of initiatives which bring together current and past pupils, state schools and\nthe wider Hampton Community.\n5.3 Volunteers\nThe Hampton School and Hampton Pre - Prep & Prep School Parents' Associations, the Music Society and the parents of\nboys in the Boat Club voluntarily give of their time in support of the Schools by organising a variety of events and\nfunctions. Funds raised by these are used for projects which would not ordinarily be provided for within the School\nbudget.\n8\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n6.

We value thinking of others first, as well as not giving up. Our academic programme is\nbroad and balanced. Results do matter here, as they should, but meaningful progress matters too; the pleasure of\nknowing you have tried your best and have been recognised for that is a feeling that ought to inspire and endure long\nafter our days at prep school are over. We believe this is a critically important function of our role in terms of preparing\nall our pupils for successful transfer to a senior school that will be the best fit for them.\nFebruary, 2016 saw the Prep pupils and staff occupy our magnificent, new building. This momentous event was the\nculmination of many years of hard work and dedication from a great range of stakeholders and it cannot be stated\nenough what an incredible impact this event has had on the life of the School. We also changed our name from\nDen mead to Hampton Pre-P rep & Prep, to better reflect the close and collaborative nature of the relationship we enjoy\nwith Hampton School.\nInvolvement by all pupils in the extensive eo-curricular programme ofthe School is a fundamental aspect of their time\nhere. Regardless of ability in sport or the arts, children are enthusiastically encouraged to participate to the best of\ntheir ability. The extensive games programme provides many opportunities to represent the School and performing\narts productions are ambitious and imaginative. The residential trips undertaken by Years 3 to 6 not only provide a\nbreath-taking array of activities for them to try, but also valuable lessons in citizenship.\nSuccessful personal relationships sit at the heart of any successful community. We want our pupils to be confident and\nkind, happy, considerate and well-mannered. lt is a source of great joy to see these qualities, in every child, flourish.\n15\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n6.3 .2 Admissions and Pupil Numbers\nCurrently the School is full from Years 1- 6, w ith the Kindergarten and Reception Year groups close to full.

Close to 100 families visited the Pre-Prep & Prep . Interest in places\nfor all Year groups continues to grow. In November 2016 we will be holding a further Open Morning plus our 7+\nAssessment Morning for pupils seeking a place in Year 3, September 2017.\n6.3 .3Developments and Maintenance\nThe construction of the new Prep building on the Gloucester Road was completed in time for occupation at the\nbeginning of the summer 2016 term.\n6.4 Fund raising performance\nThere were no material fundraising activities in the year.\n16\n•\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n7 PUBLIC BENEFIT\nHampton School has always taken and will continue to take its responsibilities as a charitable trust very seriously. The\nSchool will continue to contribute a great deal to the community. lt will, with reference to the Charities Act 2006:\n1. maintain and enhance its impressive list of public benefit activities;\n2. seek to raise new funds devoted to means-tested entry bursaries and by transferring funds from non-means-\ntested awards; and\n3. provide more means-tested Free Places.\nThe staff and pupils of the School continue to commit a great deal of time and effort to providing a wide range of public\nbenefit locally, nationally and internationally. A detailed list of Hampton School's Public Benefit work may be found on\nthe School's website, some examples of their activities are shown below. lt is a great tribute to the ethos of the School\nthat our pupils are so willing to support so many activities.\nHampton School has registered on the ISC Schools Together website and has uploaded examples of projects, including\nmathematics support for Reach Academy students and lunchtime sport and eo-curricular support for locally based\nClarendon School.\nThe Hampton Independent-State Schools Partnership {ISSP) is a link between two independent schools (Hampton\nSchool and Lady Eleanor Holies [LEH]) and five maintained schools from the Boroughs of Richmond upon Thames and\nKingston upon Thames (Orleans Park School, Hampton High, Tolworth Girls' School, Teddington School and Hollyfield\nSchool).\nThe Hampton ISSP exists for the benefit of pupils at each of the seven schools listed above. Over time, we have\ntogether built up a lively and varied programme of educational and eo-curricular opportunities, alongside the provision\nof academic support throughout the year. This has enabled pupils and teachers across the partnership to work\ncollaboratively and to draw upon the particular strengths of each school. All schools within the Hampton ISSP are\ninvited to host events across the year, during which pupils join together for activities including the following:\nMathematics, IT, Science, Design & Technology, Public Speaking, Dance, Music, and a Model United Nations\nConference.\nFor many years, the Hampton ISSP schools have supported each other with GCSE revision sessions run at weekends\nacross a range of subjects, resulting in an improvement in the final grades awarded. Pupils from the state-funded\nmember schools have been able to enjoy educational opportunities which would not otherwise have been available to\nthem, such as courses in A Level Further Mathematics. We have also been delighted to see 43 Year 8 pupils from our\nstate-funded partners enrol recently in the second iteration of a three-year Latin course run by two members of\nHampton School's Classics Department.\nThe Hampton ISSP has also led to the sharing of many of Hampton School's facilities by schools within the partnership:\nHampton School's sports facilities are used regularly by one of the schools within the partnership and joint theatre\nproductions take place on a regular basis in Hampton's Hammond Theatre.\nAs a charity the parents of our pupils have the assurance that all the income of the School must be applied for\neducational purposes. As an educational charity we enjoy tax exemption on our educational activities and on our\ninvestment income and gains provided these are applied for our charitable aims. We are entitled to an 80% reduction\non our business rates on the property we occupy for our charitable purposes. The financial benefits we receive from\nthis tax exemption are all applied for educational purposes and indirectly help us to maintain our bursary policy and our\npartnerships programme with maintained schools. However, as an educational charity, we are unable to reclaim VAT\ninput tax on our costs as we are exempt for VAT purposes. We also pay tax as an employer through the national\ninsurance contributions we make.\nIn addition to the very substantial benefits our School brings to our pupils, the local community and society through the\neducation we provide, our bursary and partnerships programmes create a social asset without cost to the Exchequer.\n17\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\nIn the past year the Hampton School Trust has educated 1,522 pupils, relieving the UK public expenditure by around £9\nmillion.\nThe Governors have had regard to the general guidance from the Charity Commission on public benefit when\ndetermining the School's objectives.\n7.1 Hampton School Public Benefit Activities:\nAcademic\n•\nA member of the Classics Department is teaching Latin GCSE to 10 pupils from local secondary schools\n•\nTwo Sixth Form pupils have been helping teach Latin each week to pupils at the Sir Richard Reynolds\nSecondary School in Twickenham\n•\nA member of the History Department o rganised a Holocaust workshop for over 100 pupils from 6 local schools.\nThese pupils were later joined by parents and members of the local community to hear an address by a\nHolocaust survivor\n•\nHampton School has been designated a Beacon School by UCL's Centre for Holocaust Education.

Detailed considerations of risk are\ndelegated to the Senior Management of the Schools apart from those relating to the Board and its membership. Risks\nare identified and assessed and controls are established throughout the year. A formal written review of the Charity's\nrisk management processes is undertaken on an annual basis.\nThis review covers the major risks and uncertainties common to all independent schools (for example, maintenance of\nhigh quality teaching staff; attraction of planned for pupil numbers; effective and controlled funding for development;\nsafeguarding; development of increasing public benefit) but also includes any more immediate, specific and shorter\nterm uncertainties\nThrough such reviews and the overall risk management processes established for the Schools, the Governors are\nsatisfied that the principal risks identified have been adequately mitigated where possible. lt is recognised that systems\ncan only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that major risks have been adequately managed.\nThe principal risks currently identified ion the School's risk register are :\nEffectiveness of the safeguarding policy and\nprocedures including the ""Prevent"" duty\nRecruitment and retention of staff\nCompliance with the Public Benefit test\nICT systems not fit for purpose\nData loss or data protection infringement\nMitigation\nAppointment of Designated Safeguarding Lead & Officers, nominating\nGovernors with lead safeguarding responsibi lity and routine reporting\nat Board meetings\nCompetitive salary and benefits including consideration to provide\naccommodation\nExtensive discussion, preparation and planning.\nMonitoring and recording of the Public Benefits provided\nAssessment of ICT systems by an external consultant and\nimplementation of their recommendations\nRobust policies, regular system backup and encryption of laptops\nThe Governors had previously identified the standard of accommodation at the Hampton Pre-Prep & Prep Gloucester\nRoad site as a principal risk. The rebuild of this facil ity was completed in early 2016.\n22\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n9. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n9.1 Financial Results\nThe financial statements show net income from unrestricted funds for the year of £2,582,310 (2015:£1,563,099).\nNet cash inflow from operating activities for the year was £3,946,875 (2015:£3,567,534).\nThe Governors are continuing their policy of deploying all net income to enhance the Schools' charitable objectives.\n9.2 Investment Powers\nInvesting activities are governed by the Trustee Act 2000.\n9.3 Investment Policy\nThe Trustees use GAM London Limited (GAM) to manage the Trust's investment portfolio. The Trustees continue to\ninstruct GAM to adopt a medium-risk approach to increase the value of the portfolio. The objective given to GAM in\n2015 was to increase the portfolio value between 7% and 10% per annum over the investment cycle.\n9.4 Investment Performance\nIn the financial year the Investments have performed in accordance with the market, expectations and the relevant\nindices.\n9.5 Fundraising Performance\nThe School received donations by regular gift aid payments from previous Appeals of £6,382.\n9.6 Asset Cover for Funds\nNote 18 to the accounts sets out an analysis of the net assets attributable to the various funds of the Charity. These\nassets are sufficient to meet the Charity's needs.\n9.7 Pension Liability\nThe Governors recognise the liability existing in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames pension scheme for\nnon-teaching staff- see notes 20 and 21. The pension liability has been reported within the accounts in accordance\nwith FRS 102.\n23\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n9.8 Other Relationships:\n9.8 .1 Millennium Boathouse\nThe administration of this facility is divided between Hampton School and Lady El ea nor Holies School (LEH). Hampton\nSchool has responsibility for the maintenance of the site and LEH for all financial operations. For ease of administration\nthe complete revenue and costs are recorded in the accounts of LEH and audited as part of its accounts. A yearly\nreconciliation takes place thus ensuring income and expenditure is evenly shared and recorded in the respective\naccounts.\n9.8.2 PupiiCoach Limited\nPupiiCoach Limited is a joint trading company wholly owned in equal shares by Hampton School and LEH. The company\nprovides a service to parents requiring help in transporting their children to and from school.\nThe licensed coaches currently carry over 1,100 pupils a day on twenty three different routes. The financial plan is to\nbreak even over the course of the financial year with any profits made by the company covenanted to the charities\n(Hampton School and LEH), or deficits shared, on an equal basis. The Bursars of the two schools act as Directors and\nnominee shareholders. The books of account are maintained and audited on a separate basis and are not consolidated\ninto these accounts. Hampton School's share of the results is shown in note 23.\n9.9 Reserves and Financial Health\nThe Governors believe that the School is in good financial health, with secure financial management and waiting lists\nfor prospective entrants to the Senior and Prep Schools stretching many years ahead. The current economic climate is\nbeing closely monitored and contingencies are in place should the economic conditions start to affect parents and cash\nflow. The Trust maintains an annual operating surplus which, supplemented by fund-raising, finances capital\nexpenditure on improving buildings, equipment and other necessary facilities. This enables the Charity to provide the\nfirst class education the parents, pupils and public have come to expect.\nThe Governors recognise that the level of reserves fluctuates and the School has invested substantial sums in the new\nSchool buildings in recent years. Adequate resources, including bank finance and unrestricted investment funds, are\navailable to provide a ""safety net"" should they be required.\nThe Governors regularly review the level and nature of the reserve funds of the School. The total value of School funds\nat 31 August 2016 was £32,058,546 of which unrestricted funds totalled £27,022,031, endowed funds £4,973,466 and\nrestricted funds £63,049. Within the investment portfolio are funds allocated for bursaries which, although designated,\nare unrestricted funds. The value of the Bursary fund at 31 August 2016 was £2,557,040 and this is available as\nunrestricted reserves for the School should the need arise. The funds are detailed in notes 15, 16 and 17.\nFree reserves are in line with Governors' expectations.\nThe Governors aim to generate net income each year which will increase the reserves available.\nThe Property Reserves will be increased over time to equal the net amount invested in property.\nlt is intended to continue to build and retain other funds as reserves when the Property Reserves are fully\nfunded.\nlt is anticipated that the Fitzwygram Foundation (see note 24) will assist in the provision of bursaries at the\nSchool in the future.\n9.10 Appointment of auditors\nIn December 2015 the Governors re-appointed haysmacintyre as the School auditors for the financial year 2015- 2016.\nThe Governors will consider a resolution proposing haysmacintyre as auditors for financial year 2016-2017.\n24\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nGOVERNORS' REPORT (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n9.11 Statement of Governors' Responsibilities\nThe Governors (who are the directors of Hampton School for the purposes of company law) are responsible for\npreparing the Governors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards).\nCompany law requires the Governors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.

There have been no\nnumerical changes as a result of the transition to FRS 102, the reserves position is unadjusted from the previously\nreported position.\nThe accounts are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, as modified by the revaluation of\ninvestments.\nThe School is a Public Benefit Ent ity registered as a charity in England and Wales . Hampton School Foundation\nCharity became a charitable company, limited by guarantee, on 1 September 2007.\nGoing concern\nHaving reviewed the School's future projected cash flows and the funding facilities available to the School\ntogether with the expected ongoing demand for places, the Governors have a reasonable expectation that the\nSchool has adequate resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and consider that there were\nno material uncertainties over the School's financial viability. Accordingly, they also continue to adopt the going\nconcern basis in preparing the financial statements as outlined in the Statement of Accounting and Reporting\nResponsibilities on page 25.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the accounting policies, Governors are required to make judgement, estimates and\nassumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are\nconsidered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates\nare recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the\nperiod of the revision and future periods if the revision affected current and future periods.\nJudgements made by the Governors in the application of these policies that have significant effect on the financial\nstatements and estimates with a sign ificant risk of material misstatement in the next year are deemed to be in\nrelation to the depreciation rates of tangible fixed assets and are discussed below.\nIn the view of the Governors, no assumptions concerning the future or estimation uncertainty affecting assets or\nliabilities at the balance sheet date are likely to result in a material adjustment to their carrying amounts in the\nnext fina ncial year.\n32\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered\nmaterial in relation to the School's financial statements.\nFees and similar earned income\nFees receivable and charges for services and use of the premises, less any allowances, scholarships, bursaries\ngranted by the School against those fees, but including contributions received from restricted funds, are\naccounted for in the period in which the service is provided.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income from dividends, bank balances and fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals\nbasis .\nDonations, legacies, grants and other voluntary income\nVoluntary income is accounted for as and when entitlement arises, the amount can be reliably quantified and the\neconomic benefit to the School is considered probable.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings on a direct cost basis. The irrecoverable element of VAT is included\nwith the item of expense to which it relates. Any expenses incurred with recoverable VAT are shown net of VAT.\nTangible fixed assets and depreciation\nItems purchased with a cost of greater than £5,000 are depreciated. Depreciation is provided at the following\nannual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful economic life.\nFurniture, fixtures & fittings, office equipment\nKitchen, administrative and teaching equipment\nMotorised equipment\nComputer equipment\nSecurity & control systems\nProperty improvements\nMotor vehicles\nRowing boats\nFreehold property\nLeasehold property\nAnnual impairment reviews are carried out.\n15% on cost\n15% on cost\n20% on cost\n50% on cost\n33.3% on cost\n10% on cost\n25% on cost\n10% on cost\n2% on cost with 10% residual value\n2% on cost with 10% residual value or term of\nlease if shorter\nWhere assets are fully depreciated by the balance sheet date they are eliminated from the accounts in the\nfollowing year.\nFund accounting\n•\nUnrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the Governors in furtherance of the general\nobjectives of the Charity .\n•\nDesignated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the Governors for particular purposes.\n•\nRestricted funds are subject to restrictions on their expenditure imposed by the donor.\n•\nEndowment funds are held permanently and are represented by investments and certain property.\n33\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nPension Schemes\nThe School contributes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme and to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames\nPension Fund at rates set by their actuaries and advised to the school by their administrators. These are defined\nbenefit multi-employer pension schemes. For the former it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities of\nthe scheme that are attributable to the School and the School does not benefit from any surpluses on the scheme\nnor share in any losses. Accordingly, under FRS 102 the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined\ncontribution scheme. The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Pension Fund was closed to support staff\njoining the School after 1 April 2009. The School also contributes to The Pensions Trust Pension Scheme for\nsupport staff joining the School after 1 April 2009. This is a money purchase scheme with a current employer\ncontribution of 8% per annum and employee contribution of 4% per annum.\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames 2015 information has been restated where necessary to comply\nwith FRS 102.\nOperating Leases\nRentals payable are charged on a time basis over the lease term.\nRealised and unrealised gains/losses\nRealised gains/losses are recorded in the accounts at the date of disposal. Unrealised gains/losses are recorded at\nthe balance sheet date.\nAdvanced Fee Payments\nParents may enter into a contract with the School to pay tuition fees in advance and by doing so they receive a\ndiscount.\nAcceptance Deposits\nWhen parents choose not to send a pupil to the School after formally accepting a place the acceptance deposit is\nretained according to the School's terms and conditions.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nBasic financial cost instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost with the exception of investments which are held at fair value. Financial assets held at amortised\ncost comprise cash at bank and in hand, together with trade and other debtors. A specific provision is made for\ndebts for which recoverability is in doubt. Cash at bank and in hand is defined as all cash held in instant access\nbank accounts and used as working capital. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise all creditors except\nsocial security and other taxes and provisions. Assets and liabilities held in foreign currency are translated to\nsterling at the balance sheet date at an appropriate exchange rate.\n34\nHAMPTON SCHOOL\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2016\n2.

It was incorporated as a limited liability Company and wholly\nowned subsidiary of The Woodard Corporation (charity number 1096270) in 1999.\nWoodard schools strive for the best all round education of every aspect of each individual; they ensure high standards of\nreligious education; and they see themselves as communities working together for the benefit of all members, and of the\nChurch and the nation. They are strong Christian foundations which adhere to catholic belief as found in the Church, to\nChristian Worship focused in the Eucharist, and to the care of each individual and the whole school community particularised\nin the ministry of the Chaplain.\nSTRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT\nGoverning Document\nThe Company is governed by its Articles of Association, adopted by Special Resolution on 20 March 2013 and replacing those\ndated 6 July 2005 amended by Special Resolution on 25 January 2006. The Articles permit funds to be managed in such a\nmanner as the directors see fit, provided that such powers are only exercised for the purposes of attaining the objects and\nin a manner which is legally charitable. They forbid the distribution of any property and funds, which are to be applied solely\ntowards the promotion of the objects of the Company.\nGoverning Body\nThe Directors of the Company, who are also the trustees of the Charity, together comprise the governing body of\nHurstpierpoint College. Directors are elected to hold office for five years and are eligible to stand for re-election. The\nDirectors who held office during the year are listed on page 1. None has any beneficial interest in the Company.\nAll Directors are Corporate Fellows (members) of the Woodard Corporation, and are committed to its charitable objects.\nCorporate Fellows are responsible for electing the Woodard Corporation Board.\nRecruitment and Training of Governors\nGovernors are recruited from a wide range of College contacts and from others in the local community. The governing body\nlooks to ensure a mix of skills, and select new governors on the basis of background, competence, specialist skills and, in the\ncase of Fellows, Christian commitment. Governors are provided with induction training by the Head, Bursar and staff, and a\nwider programme of training events is organised by the Woodard Corporation. The College also arranges training sessions\nand encourages governors to attend seminars run by the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools (AGBIS).\nOrganisational Management\nThe Directors meet as a Council four times each year to determine general policy of the Company and review its overall\nmanagement and control, for which they are legally responsible. The work of implementing the majority of the Council’s\npolicies is delegated to a number of committees, membership of which is outlined on page 1.\nThe Finance Committee has a remit to consider budgets, both revenue and capital, cash flow information and financial\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n3\nreports, including the financial statements. It also considers financial policies and the financial regulations. It makes\nrecommendations to the Council for approval. The Finance Committee met three times during the year.\nThe Education Committee is responsible for oversight of the academic performance of the College and for\neducational policy, making recommendations to the Council. It met three times during the year.\nThe Estate Committee develops the College’s estates strategy, including capital developments and maintenance of\nthe buildings, and it makes recommendations to the Council.

It also met three times during the year.\nThe role of the Governance and Nominations Committee is to ensure the Council adheres to the highest\nstandards of internal governance and to consider and propose changes to the membership of the Council. The\nCommittee met twice during the year.\nThe day to day running of the College is the responsibility of the Head and the Bursar, supported by the Senior Management\nTeam.\nGroup Structure and Relationships\nThe College has three wholly-owned non-charitable subsidiaries, Hurst Facilities Limited, Hurst Transport Limited (formerly\nHurst Tech Ltd) and Hurst International Ltd, the activities and trading of which are described below. Note 28 provides\ndetails of connected charities.\nThe College has developed links with a wide range of organisations to ensure the widest possible access to our facilities and\nschooling. Through membership of HMC and IAPS and through networking with peer groups we ensure that we are able to\nattain the highest standards of quality and performance. We encourage our pupils to develop an awareness of the social\ncontext of the all-round education they re ceive at the school and they are engaged in a number of activities to enhance their\nunderstanding. We have an alumni group, the Old Johnians, who are generous in supporting the work of the College and\nwhose support we greatly appreciate. We also cooperate with many local charities in our ongoing endeavours to widen\npublic access to the schooling we can provide, to optimise the educational use of our cultural and sporting facilities and to\nawaken in our pupils, in the public interest, an awareness of the social context of the all-round education they receive.\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES\nCharitable Objects\nThe Charity’s objects, as set out in the Memorandum of Association, are to promote and extend education in accordance\nwith the doctrines and principles of the Church of England, through the operation of Hurstpierpoint College. Within these\nObjects, the Charity also has to maintain its heritage endowment, the College with its Grade 2 chapel and listed buildings,\nand also has various endowed and restricted funds held for special purposes in connection with the development of the\nCollege’s facilities as well as for scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other educational purposes.\nIn setting objectives and planning activities the Directors have given careful consideration to the Charity Commission’s general\nguidance on charitable purposes and public benefit, and in particular to its supplementary guidance on the advancement of\neducation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is a charitable trust which seeks to benefit the public through the pursuit of its\nstated aims. Fees are set at a level to ensure the financial viability of the College and at a level that is consistent with the aim\nof providing a first class education to all pupils. The College’s charitable objectives are ‘to promote and extend education’,\nand these objectives are recognised as benefiting the public when pursued in the context of formal education in a body where\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n4\nall surplus funds are re-invested. The Woodard Corporation and all of the schools it owns are charitable bodies, with no\nexternal shareholders and no possibility of making distributions, whether in the form of dividends or otherwise. All surpluses\nare re-invested in education.\nThe College welcomes pupils from all backgrounds. To admit a prospective pupil we need to be satisfied that we will be able\nto educate and develop them to the best of their potential and in line with the general standards achieved by their peers.\nEntrance interviews and assessments are undertaken to satisfy ourselves and parents that potential pupils can cope with the\npace of learning and benefit from the education we provide. An individual’s economic status, gender, ethnicity, race, religion\nor disability do not form any part of our assessment processes.\nThe College is an equal opportunity organisation that is committed to a working environment free from any form of\ndiscrimination, whether on the grounds of colour, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or disability, and we\nmake reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of staff or pupils who are or become disabled.\nCharitable Activities\nThe principal activity of the Charity continues to be the provision of education to pupils ranging from 4 to 18 years of age. It\nalso runs a number of activity sessions during the school holidays which are open to both pupils and non-pupils of the College,\nand the College facilities are available at other times for use by the local community.\nThe College comprises three constituent schools. The Senior School is a boarding and day school for pupils aged 13-18,\nwhilst the Preparatory School (which is a day school) is for pupils aged from 7-13 . The Pre-Prep is for 4-7 year-olds.\nThe College provides a very high standard of education and this is validated in review of the academic results, our\nmeasurements of added value and through external inspection. It offers a broad curriculum and educates children with a\nrange of abilities. Our aim is to support children in reaching their potential in all areas of their activity at the College. This\nmay be in academic subjects but can just as easily be reflected in success in art, drama, sport, music or dance. We produce\nwell-rounded individuals who make a positive contribution to society.\nGrant Making\nThe College does not make grants to external bodies.\nSTRATEGIES AND POLICIES SUPPORTING THE CHARITABLE OBJECTS\nPublic Benefit Aims and Intended Impact\nIn order to meet the Charity’s objects, the College aims to create an environment to nurture children, to get the best from\nthem and to allow them to develop and fulfil their full potential. We provide them with a first-class education, independent\nof the maintained sector, and a wide range of sporting, artistic and extra-curricular opportunities, and our over-arching public\nbenefit aim is that all pupils will have the skills, the confidence and the intention to contribute to the wider community.\nIn the furtherance of these aims the Directors, as the Charity trustees, have complied with the duty in s.17 of the Charities\nAct 2011 to have due regard to the Charity Commission’s published general and relevant sub-sector guidance concerning the\noperation of the Public Benefit requirement under that Act.\nWoodard and its schools provide a significant benefit to the public. The College strives to ensure that measures of public\nbenefit are appropriate, and that significant sections of the public are not excluded from the opportunity to benefit from the\neducation and facilities offered due to the need to pay a fee. In addition to significant provision of bursaries and other forms\nof financial support, the College provides a wide range of opportunities for community benefit and facilities and events are\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n5\noften open to all. Further detail of the public benefit offered is included in the section entitled ‘Review of Achievements and\nPerformance for the Year’ below.\nIt is a key requirement of evidencing public benefit that any private benefit to individuals or elements of the charity will be\nincidental to the charity's objectives. An example of private benefit may be the reimbursement of travelling expenses for\ntrustees attending training courses: any private benefit to individuals or elements of Woodard are incidental to delivery of\nthe charitable objectives.\nStrategic Aims\nThe Directors conducted a review of the College’s long-term strategic plan during the year. There were no significant\nchanges to the College’s long-term strategic aims, which are:\n\nto be the first choice, co-educational, medium-sized, weekly, flexi-boarding and day school for pupils within an hour’s\ndrive who seek a genuinely excellent all round education with a strong academic core;\n\nto maintain and optimise pupil numbers to ensure the long-term viability of the College, to achieve necessary economies\nof scale and to generate sufficient funds to maintain and improve the physical infrastructure of the College;\n\nto continue academic improvement and development, by maintaining and fostering a successful and vibrant academic\nenvironment throughout the College and particularly through the strengthening of the sixth form provision;\n\nto develop the facilities to an excellent standard; and\n\nto widen public access to our system of schooling as far as possible within the constraints of our funding as an\nindependent education-provider.\nAccess Policy\nIt is important to us that access to the education we offer is not restricted to those who can afford our fees. A great deal of\nlearning occurs through social interaction, conversation and shared experiences, and we believe our pupils benefit from\nlearning within a diverse community where they are able to develop an understanding of the perspectives of other people\nthat will be vital in their adult lives.\nOur various concessions policies, as detailed below, contribute to a widening of access to the education we offer and the\nfacilities we enjoy. These policies are kept under regular review to ensure that able children can accept offers of places at\nthe College regardless of their parental circumstances and means.\nAwards Policy\nThe College is committed to attracting pupils of the highest calibre through scholarships and other awards; and broadening\naccess by offering means-tested financial support in the form of bursaries to eligible parents (or guardians) to assist with the\npayment of the College fees.\nScholarship awards are given for academic potential; for excellence in the fields of music, art, drama, dance and sport; or on\nthe basis of all-round ability. The awards – which are not subject to means testing – involve a fixed remission of fees of\nbetween 5% and 25%. Where further assistance is required, scholarship awards can be supplemented by a means-tested\nbursary. Bursaries – which are available to all holders of scholarship awards and are made solely on the basis of parental\nmeans – are important in helping to ensure that children from families who would otherwise not be able to afford the fees\ncan access the education we offer.\nBursary awards are available for up to 100% of basic fees and additional sums may be provided to meet the cost of extra-\ncurricular activities, equipment and school trips. In addition, bursaries are also available to relieve hardship where a current\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n6\npupil’s education and future prospects would otherwise be at risk – for example, in the case of redundancy. In assessing\nmeans we use the methodology promulgated by the Independent Schools’ Bursars Association, which takes a number of\nfactors into consideration including family income, assets and savings, as well as family circumstances – for example, dependant\nrelatives and the number of siblings.\nThe College Endowment Fund has been established in order to build an endowment that will be used to provide bursarial\nsupport to talented pupils in future. It is funded by donations from existing parents and transfers from unrestricted funds.\nFor the time being, however, the College does not have a meaningful endowment and in funding our awards we have to be\nmindful that we must ensure a balance between fee-paying parents – many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to\nfund their child’s education – and those benefiting from the awards.\nThe criteria for Awards and the application process are detailed on the College website and in the College’s Scholarship\ninformation booklets which are published annually. The availability of scholarship awards and bursaries is advertised widely\nthroughout the year in the local press and details of the schemes are provided to all parents making enquiries about possible\nentry to the College.\nDetails of bursary and other awards are included in the Strategic Report below and in note 2 to the accounts.\nOther Assistance\nTo underline the value we place on continuity for families, at the beginning of the year we increased the discounts offered to\nparents with more than one child at the College; while as part of our emphasis on attracting and retaining high-calibre staff\nwe continue to offer a discount scheme to members of the teaching staff who choose to educate their children with us.\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nREVIEW OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR\nObjectives for 2014/15\nThis year our primary objectives were to:\n\nConsolidate pupil numbers and maintain the academic standard of students joining Hurst;\n\nRestructure the timetable and curriculum provision across the College for September 2015 onwards to allow for the\nrevised GCSE and A level courses and produce a coherent academic journey through the College for every pupil;\n\nDevelop the use of data for academic purposes in the Prep and Pre Prep and embed and strengthen the culture of\nlearning across the entire College;\n\nComplete the review of the IT provision at the College, and develop a College-wide strategy for the use of all\ntechnologies in teaching and learning;\n\nCreate a development office to help build and support the newly formed Hurst Society, in order to focus and consolidate\nthe activities of our alumni and parental groups; and\n\nComplete the central academic axis at the College by undertaking the final stage of the science block redevelopment\nand constructing a further extension to the classroom block.\nPupil Numbers\nPupil numbers at the College during the year were as follows:\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n7\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nSenior School\n738\n(371 boarders)\n730\n(382 boarders)\nPreparatory School\n290\n292\nPre-Preparatory School\n54\n69\n_____\n_____\nTotal\n1,082\n(371 boarders)\n1,091\n(382 boarders)\n_____\n_____\nThe number of boys and girls educated was as follows:\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nSenior School\n404\n334\n400\n329\nPreparatory School\n151\n139\n166\n127\nPre-Preparatory School\n31\n23\n39\n30\n_____\n_____\n_____\n_____\nTotal\n586\n496\n605\n486\n_____\n_____\n_____\n_____\nAchievement of the Year’s Objectives\nThe objectives set for 2014/15 were largely met.\n\nAlthough overall pupil numbers declined slightly, this was principally a result of the decision three years ago to move to\none form entry in the Pre-Prep school and there was a further increase in pupil numbers in the Senior School, which\nwas achieved despite the College setting higher standards for entry at both 13+ and 16+;\n\nFollowing a detailed review, and in the light of the changes announced by the Government to GCSE and A level courses,\nthe timetable and curriculum provision across the College was revised, to ensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent,\nlinear academic programme;\n\nThe on-line Grades and Reporting System in use in the Senior School for assessing, reporting and monitoring pupil\nprogress was extended throughout the Prep and Pre-prep schools;\n\nFollowing a review of the IT provision at the College, the decision was taken to provide all pupils entering year 9 with a\nCollege lap-top and to out-source the IT support function from August 2015;\n\nWork commenced on two major building projects to complete the central academic axis at the College: the final stage\nof the science block redevelopment, incorporating new science laboratories, a lecture room as well as extended facilities\nfor design technology; and a further extension to the classroom block, including new teaching rooms for drama.\nAcademic Hurst\nIn terms of public examination results, 2014-15 was a highly successful year, with records broken by all three of our external\nexamination year groups.\nOur A*/B percentage at A level rose for the fourth year in succession so that 77.5% of our A2 results were A*/B grades and\n66 A* grades were achieved overall. Altogether thirty eight pupils gained 3As or better, and A* and A grades made up 49.5%\nof the overall results. Our BTEC Sport class achieved stunning results once more with 100 % Distinctions Starred. One pupil\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n8\nachieved 4A*s in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics and Physics whilst another managed to\nobtain a top D1 grade in the Philosophy and Theology Pre–U course (alongside 2 A* graded A Levels). When all the UCAS\npoints achieved by our U6th pupils were counted up, the average score per candidate was 356.0 .\nAll those who held provisional Oxbridge or medical offers secured their places, and, in total, 78 students (82% of all those\nproceeding to university this year) went to Russell Group or ex-1994 Group universities to embark on a variety of courses\nranging from Accounting to Veterinary Nursing.\nAt AS level, the class of 2015 saw 29 students achieving three A grades or better, and the highest percentage of A&B grades\never. On results day the statements of results showed 37.6% A grades, with three pupils each having 5 A grades. Seventeen\nstudents gained at least 4 A grades and sixteen had nothing other than A grades on their results statements.\nAt GCSE level, 2015 also brought our highest ever A*/A percentage (66.5%) alongside a record A*/B percentage of 90.6,\nOverall, our fifth form students achieved 423 A* grades, making up 30.9% of our total GCSE grades. Sixty eight pupils gained\n8 or more A* & A grades, while twenty six pupils had only A* and A grades on their statements of results and fourteen had\n11 or more A* & A grades. Our iGCSE results were again very strong with 66.2% of all the grades in biology, chemistry and\nphysics being A* grades and 92.5% being A* & A grades. Individually, one student gained 11A*s and 1A grade whilst three\nothers achieved 11 A* grades, and another thirty three students collected 10 A* & A grades or better. Three students also\nachieved the top grade of A^ in Further Mathematics.\nAlongside the existing iPad project, and in response to pupil demand for a more functional resource, we are now\nintroducing a laptop programme to pupils in year 9 of the Senior School. This will provide centrally managed, backed-up\nand monitored devices for pupils and staff to support classroom learning. This will mean every pupil in the Senior School\nwith the exception of Year 13 – many of whom already have their own devices –will be digitally enabled. In the Prep\nSchool, digital tasks continue to be embedded into all areas of the curriculum and, with a number of class sets of iPads in\ncirculation, teachers from Reception through to Year 6 are able to easily incorporate digital learning opportunities into all\nsubjects of the curriculum. As technology becomes a natural and necessary part of every child’s education, so a shift is\noccurring, moving us away from stipulating specific programmes and methods to make use of these digital devices, to\nproviding them and allowing pupils and teachers to utilize them as they see fit to enhance the learning.\nPupil Welfare\nThe College is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of its pupils and expects all staff and volunteers to share\nthis commitment. In the last Independent Schools Inspectorate report, it was recognised that this commitment was given the\nhighest priority, and the quality of the pastoral care at the College was described as excellent. The College has appointed a\nDirector of Safeguarding whose remit is to train all staff and ensure that safeguarding practices and procedures are\nimplemented consistently across the College, and with effect from September 2015 there will be a Deputy Head responsible\nfor all pastoral care in the College.\nParents are given regular information about their children’s social and academic progress through parent evenings, through\nthe College’s innovative challenge grades which are reviewed and reported approximately every four weeks, and through an\nannual report. We also maintain regular contact with parents throughout the year through informal contacts, regular social\nevents organised in houses and for year groups, and regular newsletters. Parents are also invited to attend talks on pastoral\nissues such as on-line safety and mental health.\nAll pupils have a House Parent who is responsible for their pastoral care and a Tutor responsible for their academic\ndevelopment. We also have a system of student guardians who are involved in assisting staff in enforcing our pro-active anti-\nbullying policy, while pupils also have confidential access to professional Counsellors who visit the school weekly. In addition,\nmedical help is on hand at the College’s Medical Centre.\nThe College runs a Student Council so that concerns of the pupil body can be raised and voiced, and these are taken to the\nHouse Parents’ meeting which is attended by members of the Senior Management Team. In addition, the College Prefects\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n9\nhave a weekly meeting where welfare concerns are also raised.\nCreative Hurst\nThe main focus for the dance department this year was to present performances in a variety of venues and with different\nstarting points to avoid predictability. The annual Dance Showcase was ‘Retrograde’, which celebrated 10 years of dance at\nHurst, involving dances performed over the past 10 years by all three schools, along with new material and as an added\ndimension and, for the first time, a couple of former pupils returned to perform the dances they had originally done when\nat the College. The dance department also collaborated on the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. The number of boys\nparticipating in extra-curricular dance and opting for GCSE dance is increasing and there are now a number of different\ndance companies, all of whom have residential workshops or perform outside of the College. Dance in the Prep and Pre-\nprep schools continues to develop, with a number of pupils taking ballet exams and several after-school dance activities,\nincluding the popular boys’ street dance.\nThe Music Department was busy as always. It contributed again to the Hurst Festival, providing a concert in the village and\nan afternoon’s entertainment with tea and cake in the College itself. The house music competition involved everybody in\nthe Senior School singing with their respective houses, while the size of the choir has increased again and is now140-strong.\nThe choir sang at every chapel service and excelled particularly in the candle-lit advent procession, the festival of 9 lessons\nand carols, and the leavers’ service. The Chamber choir sang carols to the elderly at a variety of locations in and around\nthe village and was once again the choir in residence at the Walsingham National Pilgrimage.\nA choral day for visiting Prep schools led by the director of music was popular and the final concert was a great success, as\nwas the concert given by the choral society of parents and friends concert which was accompanied by a professional\norchestra. The jazz and rock concert and ‘Hurst unplugged’ were well attended, successful events, giving both bands and\nsolo acts a great performance opportunity, while the Jazz band gave successful concerts to the U3A and at the United\nReformed Church in Burgess Hill. With the retirement of Derick Austin, this year’s ‘Hurst n’Brie’ was devoted to bands\nand past pupils that had been taught by him. As always, this concert was very successful and a great way to round off the\nacademic year.\nIndividually our pupils achieved success in the annual Mid-Sussex music festival and in our own solo music competition.\nNow established as an annual event, the upper sixth formers performed concerto movements accompanied by a\nprofessional orchestra. There are now record numbers of pupils at the College who have achieved grade 8, and a number\ncurrently play in the Brighton Youth and the South Downs’ Youth Orchestras.\nPrep school music remained very strong with a full calendar of events throughout the year. Highlights included the winter\nconcert showcasing the various orchestras and ensembles, the Jazz concert in the Lent term, the outdoor summer concert\nand, particularly, a successful choir tour to Amsterdam.\nFinally, we were delighted to welcome back an old boy, Richard Hadfield, as a member of the 2014 Britain’s Got Talent\nwinners, Collabro who used the Bury Theatre as a venue for their dress rehearsal prior to a national tour. Tickets for the\nconcert were sold out within half an hour and the proceeds will be used for supporting future overseas tours by the music,\ndrama and sport departments.\nThis Art and Photography Department started this year with an exhibition of old books transformed into artwork which\nshowed a stunning level of skill and commitment by students. This set the standard for the rest of the year and the three\ntermly art shows were the best yet. Pupils visited a number of galleries, including Kew, Jerwood, the Royal Academy, the\nNational Gallery and the Tate, while the AS visited the Biennale art show in Venice. The year culminated with a brilliant set\nof exam results for all years, including A*-B grades in GCSE art, 79% A-B in AS art and photography, and 75% A*-B grades at\nA2 in art and photography.\nIn drama, there was a huge range of diverse theatre trips, workshops and showcase performances. The College staged over\n20 productions during the year, 110 students being involved in productions in the Michaelmas term alone. We again\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n10\nparticipated in the local arts festival, the Hurst Festival, and this year 10 fifth form drama scholars performed ‘Grandfathers’\nby Rory Mullarkey. The College has been performing Shakespeare plays annually at the College since 1854 and this year’s\noffering was ‘Twelfth Night’, which had a cast predominately comprising Shell drama scholars and was directed by the\nCollege’s Playwright in Residence. In addition, an Upper Sixth former, Horatio Gould, wrote and directed his second play,\n‘Rex’, and Hurst in Rep incorporated a series of six plays directed by the two gap students and four Sixth formers, one of\nwhom also wrote one of the plays. The major showpiece event of the year was the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. Owing\nto the unprecedented demand for roles, the decision was taken to cast only year 10 students and above, but even so the cast\nstill numbered over 60. This was an excellent show with strong leads and a hired-in set.\nAlso in the Lent term the annual house film competition took place, with each house producing their own films, written and\ndirected by members of the house and supported by a professional production company, followed by a pre-screening in a\nlocal cinema. During the summer term sixth form students appeared in a stunning version of Steven Berkoff’s ‘Kvetch’, in\nMartin Crimp’s’ ‘Attempts On Her Life’ and Odon von Horath’s ‘Don Juan Comes back From The War’. There were also\ntwo major productions exclusively for Year 9 students, including the annual Shell Shakespeare Festival and the musical ‘Fame’,\nwhich gave a large number of junior pupils the opportunity to take lead roles and to be trained in the levels of discipline\nnecessary for the main school musical when they are older. In addition, the lower sixth form drama scholars this year\nshowcased the work of a female playwright, Caryl Churchill, while the upper sixth form leavers rounded off the year with a\nperformance of Disney’s ‘Aladdin’.\nIn the Prep school, the year 7/8 production in the Michaelmas term was Disney’s ‘Beauty and the Beast’ which had a huge\ncast. The year 5/6 production also involved over 80 pupils and was a musical version of Oliver, called ‘Olivia’ while the year\n3/4 production at the end of the summer term was ‘The Selfish Giant’. Both these performances were held in the new Moore\nHall, were superbly acted and hugely enjoyable. In addition to these main productions there was the annual Nativity play for\nyears 3/4, a ‘play in a day’, the LAMDA showcase, the Scholars’ performance (the Basil the Rat episode from Fawlty Towers)\nand a drama activity performance, while on an individual level over 80 children took LAMDA exams with well over half\nachieving distinctions.\nSporting Hurst\n2014/15 was probably one of the most rewarding and successful years for sport at the College in recent times and this was\nreflected in the results of the various sporting teams both at the elite and participation levels. In line with this success, the\nCollege continues to develop its sporting programme and profile and the recent opening of a new gym will assist this further.\nIn line with the increased number of pupils at the College, we are running more sports and more teams than ever, and our\nmajor sports of rugby, hockey, netball, cricket and athletics continue to flourish.\nRugby dominates the Michaelmas term programme for boys and we are still developing our fixture list which now sees us\nplaying stronger schools across the South East and whilst the take-up for the sport is good the College must continue to\nencourage boys to participate in order to match the ever more competitive nature of the list. The College’s U13s, U14s and\nU16s were all crowned county champions this year and the 1st XV reached the last 32 in the NatWest Vase national\ncompetition, whilst on an individual level Hurst continues to supple a steady stream of players to the county age group sides\nand also to the Harlequins academy. The College is also an official RFU Coach Education Centre, holding a variety of courses\nfor coaches and referees, and we regularly host County teams. Seven-a side rugby is also growing in stature, and we entered\nteams in 6 tournaments last year.\nThe Schools hockey has gone from strength to strength over the last few years, particularly since the opening of our second\nAstro pitch. The boys 1st XI came third in the National Hockey Competition at the Lee Valley stadium, which was a fantastic\nachievement for this group, many of whom had come all the way through our Prep school, and from Boys U14D up to 1st\nXI the College won 79% of all games played. We are now consistently competing at the top level both indoors and outdoors\nand we had 9 boys attending the Junior Regional Performance Centre, 4 on the AASE programme and 3 playing for England\nU17s. Of the girls, 10 attended at JRPC this year, 2 were on the AASE programme and 1 played for England U17s. With\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n11\nmore clubs and academies now training at the school after hours, the pupils at all levels get a chance to be part of a club or\ndevelopment academy to further their hockey skills. The College also hosts training and home games for Sussex hockey and\nis now seen as a hub for hockey in the county, and with a number of coaches employed full time, a player welfare team and\nan sports and conditioning coach we are looking to give the pupils every opportunity to improve and perform at all levels.\nNetball also had an outstanding year, which cements Hurst’s reputation as the school to beat both within the county and\nbeyond and we have a number of players in the Sussex Netball Academies. Our U15s were SISNA winners and runners up\nin the Sussex Knock-Out Cup. The 1st VII were runners up at both SISNA and the Sussex Knock Out Cup, while the 16As\nhad a fantastic season, qualifying for the regional round of National Schools and winning both SISNA and the Sussex Knock\nOut Cup. The U13s also became county champions.\nCricket at the College has never been stronger and the College did not lose a block fixture against another school last\nsummer. The 1st XI were national champions at T20 as well as winning the Langdale Trophy as Sussex Under 18 T20 Cup\nwinners and the Woodard Schools Trophy. The College continues to have strong links with Sussex CCC and this year will\nhave three players in the Sussex Academy. Three boys gained national caps, for England U19, England U17 and the Dutch\nNational side, while a fourth was named in the team of the tournament for a recent ICC T20 Word Cup qualifying tournament.\nThe minor sports programme is also expanding, with football and triathlon attracting more pupils, and regular competitive\nfixtures. Girls’ cricket now has three teams, with the U15A team winning the Sussex Softball Competition, while girls’ tennis\nnow comprises eight squads. Boys and girls athletics has always been strong at Hurst and we continue to be a major player\nin Sussex with a substantial medal haul and county representation. Add to this squash, aerobics, polo, gymnastics, sailing, golf,\nrounders and swimming, and it is evident that the College has a strong and diverse sports programme.\nSport in the Prep School also continued to flourish at all levels.\nIn boys' sport, the senior football teams were particularly successful and the rugby results were also good with several boys\nalso playing club rugby and one player involved with Harlequins academy. The U13 boys won the rugby County Cup final,\nbut the strength and depth of our teams is something we continue to pride ourselves on, and the football season saw every\nboy in the school play for a team with some fine results against tough opposition. The hockey teams also performed well in\nseveral tournaments and the U13 boys were crowned County Champions, while cricket remains a strength with a number\nof boys playing club and representative cricket in the County.\nGirls' hockey has been going from strength to strength, having benefitted particularly from a number of our specialist hockey\ncoaches working with the children, and the U13s were County Champions in the 11-a-side game. Netball in the school also\ncontinued to develop well, and during the year we hosted our fourth ‘Hocnet’ tournament including competitive hockey and\nnetball skills alongside short matches, which was very well received. The U11 netball team qualified for the national IAPS\nfinal, a first for Hurst, and although the U13 team just missed out on qualifying they ended the season by winning the Sussex\nKnockout Cup. Rounders remains popular in the summer, but we also had numerous cricket fixtures with many girls\nparticipating, and this is a growing sport for girls across the college.\nMinor sports such as tennis, athletics, swimming and cross country were all well represented with swimming proving\nparticularly popular. Over 80 pupils also took part in the Athletics after-school club and a number represented Sussex at the\nIAPS Nationals, while the school Triathlon has become a well-established event with many children volunteering to take part\nin one of the three events in the year. In addition, the Prep school again hosted a schools’ show-jumping event at Hickstead\nand entered several teams with great success, while orienteering is again on the school calendar with many children enjoying\nthe challenges of this activity, both on and off campus.\nActivity Hurst\nOutdoor Education forms a significant part of the timetable across the whole School, with activities enriching the wider\nexperiences of pupils in all years.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n12\nOutdoor pursuits are a regular part of the games programme and an established part of our provision for all year groups,\nwith opportunities to participate in sailing, kayaking, climbing and mountain biking. This year wakeboard, wind sailing and\nsurfing trips were also offered and we held our first wakeboard competition against another school. The increase in numbers\nhas led to greater competitive success, with Hurst again winning the Independent 2014/15 Schools Ski Championships,\nincluding three individual Gold medals. The College team also came second in the 2014 Independent School Climbing\nChampionships, with a Hurst pupil winning individual Gold.\nThis year some 340 pupils were enrolled on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. There were 64 Gold enrolments, and 38\nstudents successfully completed the Gold award with another 16 expected to complete the expedition by the end of the\nyear. The success rate at silver was also impressive, with over three quarters of participants gaining the award by the end of\nthe lower sixth. In addition, the College continued to offer training sessions to the county and to local schools in the web-\nbased pupil registration and recording system for DoE award participants.\nThe weekly Duke of Edinburgh service afternoon – and especially the Combined Cadet Force – continues to increase in\npopularity, allowing pupils to broaden their horizons through volunteering, leadership and self-reliance. In addition, the BTEC\nlevel 2 in Public Services has been a particular success, with 18 students gaining a distinction or merit. During the year there\nwere a number of other community schemes – including recycling, woodland conservation, farming, community service and\nthe College’s in house Crèche – and these projects are now both well-established and worthwhile, with nearly 200 students\ninvolved. The year also saw students in the UVI return to their community project on a wholly voluntary basis outside their\nCollege commitment.\nThe year 9 and 10 activity programme, which includes self-defence, farming skills, kayaking, fencing and shooting, adds a further\ndimension to the rich and rounded education received by all pupils at Hurst, and the annual Shell multi-activity day and the\nLower Sixth leadership induction day contribute greatly to the development of pupils’ team building skills and their\nunderstanding of leadership and management.\nThe Prep School activity programme also continued to offer a wide range of options. Children in Year 8 took part in the\nannual Leavers’ Challenge which involved walking part of the South Downs Way in small groups and participating in an\nadventure activity day on route. There was also a ski trip for children in Years 5-8, French trips for pupils in years 5 and 6,\nan activity trip to Snowdonia for Year 8 pupils and an outdoor activity day for the Year 5 students. There is also a weekly\nactivity programme including kayaking, climbing and orienteering for those children who prefer not to play rugby.\nBursaries and Scholarships\nThe College aims to provide opportunities for a wide range of people, particularly those in need, to access benefits from the\nCharity and the College Endowment Fund was established in 2003 in order to accumulate funds which will be used to provide\nfinancial support to talented pupils whose family circumstances would otherwise prevent them from attending the College.\nThe intention is to build up a substantial fund over the years ahead with income earned being utilised to provide means-tested\nbursaries whilst the capital value of the fund is maintained or increased, although this would not preclude the use of capital\nat any time to provide financial support to qualifying pupils. The value of the Endowment Fund is £1.25M.\nWhilst the Endowment Fund is essentially for the future, during the year the College provided scholarships, bursaries and\nother awards exceeding £2.8M to pupils at the College from unrestricted funds. This included means-tested bursaries with\na total value of £561,000 to 59 children both to supplement scholarship awards and in cases of hardship where the pupil’s\neducation and future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Six pupils received assistance (comprising scholarships, external\ngrants and bursaries) for 100% of fees and eight others received assistance for at least 80% of fees.\nScholarships are used to ensure that we are able to maintain high standards in all areas at the College. The total value of\nscholarships awarded in the year was £1.4M . The progress of pupils receiving scholarships is reviewed at least annually to\nensure their progress is in line with their abilities. One scholarship was withdrawn in the year as a result of reviews.\nThe concessions provided by the College represented 12.9% of gross fee income.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n13\nWider Education\nHurst remains committed to the development of excellence in the classroom, not only within the confines of the College but\nusing its expertise to reach out into the wider profession to support our colleagues in both the maintained and private sectors\nof education.\nThe College continues to value the relationship that it has with its partnership Schools in the Inspire Teaching School Alliance.\nInspire is a group of like-minded schools working in partnership with two local universities to provide teachers with the skills\nand experience to become outstanding practitioners at any stage in their career. The Alliance has a particular focus on\nSchools Direct as a pathway into the teaching profession and in January 2015 Hurst organised and hosted a very successful\ntraining day for all of the School Direct trainees. We were also able to offer a second placement to one of the primary\ntrainees. Several of our staff are members of the various strategic committees within the Alliance.\nOur record for offering training to new and aspiring members of the profession continues to grow. The year saw 8 Newly\nQualified Teachers successfully complete their induction year under the umbrella of the Independent Schools Teacher\nInduction Panel. In February ISTIP inspected our NQT provision and judged the induction policy as excellent, with all NQTs\ndeemed to be focussed, engaged, and feeling very well supported. Alongside the NQTs, the College also committed to fully-\nfunding the Buckingham University PGCE course for two members of staff. The College also employed a number of\nunqualified junior teachers, whose development was supported through one-to-one mentoring, observations and INSET.\nStrong links remain between Hurst and Brighton University, from whom we receive PCGE students for either their first or\nsecond placements. Last year we were able to offer 3 placements across Art, Geography and Dance. Alongside our other\ntrainee teachers, all PGCE placement students are offered a programme of targeted INSET to further develop their practice.\nIn June, the Head of Geography hosted a forum for Geography Heads from the ‘14Group’ of schools, providing an opportunity\nto share best practice and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the forthcoming GCSE and ‘A’ level curriculum\nchanges.\nCommunity Hurst\nThe College is a part of a wider community and we are keen that our staff and pupils participate.\nIn 2015 the College was again actively involved in the local Arts Festival, staging Hurst productions as well as offering facilities,\nvehicles and equipment for festival use; and it also supported numerous local community service activities. In addition, links\nhave been formed with Warden Park, a local maintained school, and we have supported a number of joint ventures with this\nschool.\nBy developing and providing public access to new facilities, the College remains at the heart of the community. Facilities made\navailable to the public include:\nOur sports facilities, which are recognised as being of particular quality and are regularly used by numerous clubs and\norganisations including Brighton & Hove Albion FC (including Sussex Seagulls), Burgess Hill Football Club, Burgess Hill\nTown Ladies FC, Ditchling Cricket Club, Ditchling RFC, England Hockey, First Class Cricket Coaching, Headliners\nCricket, Henfield Cricket Club, Horsham Cricket & Sports Club, Hurst Colts, Hurstpierpoint Cricket Club, Hurst\nHornets FC, Hurstpierpoint Ladies Football Club, Hurstpierpoint Tennis Club, Hurstpierpoint Womens Cricket Club,\nKeymer and Hassocks Cricket Club, Mid Sussex Hockey Club, Mid Sussex Netball Club, Pure Cricket Academy, the\nRugby Football Union, St Andrew's Cricket Club, Sussex Bujin Kan (martial arts training), Sussex County Cricket Club,\nSussex County Hockey, Sussex County Netball Association, Sussex County Rugby, Sussex Martlets cricket, Sussex Netball\nClub, Sussex Nomads cycling club, Sussex RFU, Top Hats and Tutus dance club and Twineham & Wineham Cricket Club.\nThe College minibus fleet, which has been used to support the Brighton Marathon, the Longines Royal International Horse\nShow and also provided ad hoc assistance to Brighton 29th Scout Troop, Lindfield Boys Brigade, Lindfield Primary School,\nLindfield URC youth group, Southwater Scout Troop and Sussex County Netball Club.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n14\nThe College swimming pool, which is made available to local swimming clubs and organised bodies including 1st Swim\nSchool, Floaters Sports Management, Flippers and Fins, Southdown Lifesavers and Simply Swim.\nOur Chapel, which is open to the public during all services.\nSussex Pages Ltd, a business networking organisation held an event in the dining hall\nThe College grounds, which were made available to Woodlands Meed School for a sponsored walk\nThe sports hall and other facilities, which are used by the Sussex Guild, a self-help organisation for professional designers\nand makers of fine contemporary and traditional craftwork, for their major area show.\nIn addition, during school holiday periods, College facilities were made available to Sussex Police for dog team training and\nfor training sessions run by West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.\nWe also run a choral society for parents and members of the local community; and the College and Prep School Jazz Bands,\nChoirs and other groups regularly perform at charity and fund-raising events across the locality; while numerous arts events\nat the College – including plays, concerts and dance performances – are open to the public.\nWider Charitable Activity\nAs well as supporting the local community through community service activities – including conservation, helping in old\npeople’s homes and youth residential centres – the College community takes part in a wide range of sponsored events and\nother fundraising activities. During the year, through the efforts of pupils, parents and staff, the College raised over £27,000\nfor various charities.\nIn addition to this a team of Senior School pupils raised funds for the building of a school building in a remote village in Malawi.\nThey also raised funds for their own expenses and went to the location to help with its construction. In June all the Senior\nSchool pupils spent a day on various projects in the local area helping charitable and educational causes.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW AND RESULTS FOR 2014/15\nIn financial terms 2014/15 was another very successful year. Net fee income rose by modest 2.0% as a result of a the slight\ndecline in pupil numbers, an increase in fee concessions and fee increases of 3% – once again below the increases imposed by\nmany of our competitors.\nCosts were generally well contained, although these were inflated by a number of factors, primarily increased spending on\nteachers’ salaries, IT and transport, and overall resources expended increased by 2.7%, slightly ahead of the 1.8% increase in\nincoming resources. Expenditure on discretionary building projects fell by 53% to £532,000, as financial resources were\nretained for the two major capital projects which started in early 2015.\nAs a consequence of this and aided by a further £510,000 income from Activities for Generating Funds – primarily income\nfrom lettings – net incoming resources remained extremely positive at £2.42M, only slightly down on the previous year’s high.\nAs a result, operating cash-flow was once again extremely positive and sufficient to fund further capital expenditure of £3.09M\nduring the year.\nOur main trading Company, Hurst Facilities Limited, continues to hire out College facilities during vacations and school hours,\nas well as undertaking commercial activity on behalf of the school and externally (although the main educational letting is\nundertaken by the charity itself). The Company contributed the sum of £33,000 to the College’s operating surplus in 2014/15.\nThe parents of our pupils often make significant sacrifices to pay the fees. In doing so they help to relieve the state of the\nfinancial burden of educating over 1,000 UK-based children. This saving to the state is estimated to have a value in the last\nyear of £6.3M.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n15\nThe school is unable to recover the VAT on purchases it makes. During the past year, the College has paid an estimated\n£1.45M in VAT on goods and services.\nDevelopment of the College Estate\nOver the year expenditure on improvements to College facilities totalled a further £3.26M: including £1.3M on the extension\nto the science block; £1.0M on the extension to the classroom block; £186,000 on repairs to the College’s original listed\nbuildings (the latest phase of an on-going programme); £200,000 on facilities to accommodate the Colleges Estates teams;\n£101,000 on a new gymnasium; over £130,000 on improvements to boarding houses and £76,000 on improvements to the\nCollege’s historic cricket pavilion.\nInvestment Performance Against Objectives\nThe Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association permit funds to be invested in such manner as the directors see\nfit, provided that such powers of investment are only exercised for the purpose of attaining the objects and in a manner that\nis legally charitable. The governing body’s policy is to preserve the capital value of investments and maximise the return on\nall investments.\nThe College’s investments are managed by UBS Wealth Management and in the opinion of the advisers the performance has\nbeen satisfactory. The investment performance is measured against targets provided by our investment advisers. Stock\nmarket conditions showed a continued improvement over the course of the year and the investment return on the College’s\nfunds, which are now held in the UBS Resolution Income Fund, for the 12 months to 31 August 2015 was 7.81% compared\nwith the benchmark performance target return of 9.14% .\nReserves Policy\nIn common with most independent schools, the Charity’s unrestricted reserves are primarily invested in tangible fixed assets,\nwhich are all used for its direct charitable activities. This utilisation of funds is essential to ensure that high quality up-to-date\nfacilities are available for the benefit of pupils and in order to meet the increasing expectations of our parents. The Directors\nconsider that given the strength of the company’s balance sheet, the stable cash flow from full student rolls, the ongoing\npopularity of the College, and the available banking facility that can be called upon if need arises, there is no need to build up\na free reserve.\nFUTURE PLANS\nStrategic Objectives\nThe Board’s strategic plan was approved in early September 2014 and is reviewed on an annual basis. The key objectives of\nthe current plan are:\n\nTo maintain pupil numbers at the present level for both financial as well as educational reasons;\n\nTo raise academic standards and create a successful and vibrant academic environment throughout the College and to\nfoster academic entrepreneurship at every level;\n\nTo recruit high quality pupils to the College;\n\nTo strengthen the boarding ethos and maintain the number of boarders at the College by increasing the number and\nstandard of extra-curricular activities and improving the boarding provision;\n\nTo further develop key facilities across the Campus;\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n16\n\nTo widen public access to the College and its resources; and\n\nTo provide appropriate support to the Woodard Corporation in pursuit of its charitable objectives.\nObjectives for 2015/16\nDuring 2015/16, the College intends to:\n\nComplete the revision of the curriculum across the College to accommodate the revised GCSE and A level courses and\nensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent, linear academic programme;\n\nIntroduce a programme of curricular and extra-curricular activities to foster the academic development of the most able\npupils in the College;\n\nReview the boarding provision at the College and develop a strategy for its development;\n\nReview and restructure the College’s marketing activities and branding, including launching an improved website;\n\nEmbed and extend the provision of mobile technology use in and out of the classroom;\n\nComplete the development of the central academic axis at the College and plan for the next phase of campus\ndevelopment.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nRisk Management\nThe Directors are responsible for the identification and management of risks. Detailed examination of the risks is delegated\nto the relevant committee, which works with the Senior Management Team to identify risks and establish controls to mitigate\nthem. A formal review of the risk management process and judgements is undertaken annually by the complete governing\nbody.\nPrincipal Risks Facing the Charity\nThe principal risks to which the College is exposed include those affecting protection of pupils and security and preservation\nof charitable assets both now and in the future.

Basis of Accounting\nThe accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice ‘Accounting\nand Reporting by Charities’ and with applicable UK accounting standards. They are drawn up on the historical cost\naccounting basis except that investments held as fixed assets are carried at market value. Financial Reporting Standard 102,\nand a revised Statement of Recommended Practice for Charity Accounting will be applicable for the school’s financial\nstatements ending 31 August 2016.\nb. Going Concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors of the charitable Company review the financial\ninformation for the charity and the group, and consider whether the charity and group are going concerns for a period of at\nleast 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable\nexpectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.\nc. Group Accounts\nThe financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company, and all its subsidiary companies, charitable\ntrusts and funds with all inter-company balances being eliminated.\nd. Fees and Similar Income\nFees receivable are accounted for in the period in which the service is provided. Fees receivable are stated after deducting\nallowances, scholarships and other remissions granted by the school, but include contributions received from Restricted\nFunds for scholarships, bursaries and other grants. Fees in Advance are those fees received in advance of the following\nyear’s education and are shown as a short term liability until taken to income in accordance with this policy.\nAdvance Fees are those fees received in advance of education to be provided in future years under an Advance Fees Contract\nwhich are held as interest bearing liabilities until either taken to income in the term when used, or else refunded.\ne. Trading Activity and Ancillary Trading Activity\nIncome from holiday and sports hall lettings are recognised in the SOFA activities when the services are provided.\nf. Donations and Appeals\nDonations, subject to the specific wishes of the donors, are credited to relevant restricted funds or to endowed funds where\nthe amount is required to be held as permanent capital. Donations received for the general purposes of the school are\ncredited to other unrestricted funds, to distinguish them from direct school income.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n26\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nOn occasions the school may set up an appeal to raise finance at times when particular projects are being undertaken.\nMonies received are treated in accordance with the terms of the appeal documentation and are recognised as Designated\nFunds and shown under ‘Unrestricted Funds’ in the SOFA, rather than as Restricted Funds. Appeal documentation explains\nthat monies can be used for general purposes.\ng. Expenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings either on a direct cost basis or apportioned according to time spent. The\nirrecoverable element of VAT is included with the item of expense to which it relates.\nThe cost of refurbishing and converting existing buildings is written-off in the year in which it is incurred except where the\nuseful life has been extended. Bad debts are provided for in accordance with the group bad debt policy.\nh. Governance Costs\nGovernance costs include the costs attributable to Hurstpierpoint College’s compliance with constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, including audit, strategic management and govern ors’ meetings and reimbursed expenses. Such costs include\nboth direct and allocated support costs.\ni. Finance and Other Costs\nOther costs include amounts accrued in accordance with the terms of Advance Fee Contracts.\nj. Pension Costs\nThe Company participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (‘the TPS’), an unfunded Government\nscheme, for its teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate\nto consistently identify the liabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the Company. As required by Financial Reporting\nStandard (‘FRS’) 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company accounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe company offers membership of the Pensions Trust Growth Plan to all the employees other than the full-time academic\nstaff. The Pensions Trust Growth Plan is a multi-employer pension scheme where the scheme assets are pooled for\ninvestment purposes and cannot be attributed to individual employers. Benefits are paid from the total scheme assets. It is\nin most respects a money purchase arrangement, but has some guarantees. As a result it is not possible or appropriate to\nidentify the assets and liabilities of the scheme which are attributable to the company, though, due to the guarantees inherent\nin the scheme, the companies remain potentially liable for a debt on withdrawal from the scheme. In accordance with FRS\n17 therefore, the scheme is accounted for in a fashion which is similar to a defined contribution scheme. More detail is given\nin notes 26 and 27.\nThe company also contributes to other pension schemes for non-teaching staff.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n27\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nk.\nTangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Individual capital items, or projects, with a value greater than\n£10,000 are capitalised. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. They are\ntransferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.\nWhere appropriate, cost includes our own labour costs in relation to construction, and directly attributable overheads.\nWhere tangible fixed assets have been acquired with the aid of specific grants they are included in the balance sheet at cost\nand depreciated over their expected useful economic life. The related grants are credited to a restricted fixed asset fund\n(in the statement of financial activities and carried forward in the balance sheet). The depreciation on such assets is charged\nin the statement of financial activities over the expected useful economic life of the related asset on a basis consistent with\nthe depreciation policy.\nDepreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected\nuseful life, as follows:\nFreehold land is not depreciated\nFreehold buildings:\nwith an expected life over 50 years\n-\nNil\nwith an expected life under 50 years - Variable according to the building and written off over the expected\nuseful life\nunder construction\n-\nNil\nMajor items of plant\n-\n10 years\nComputer equipment\n-\n25% on cost\nFurniture and fittings\n-\n25% on cost\nPlant and equipment\n-\nbetween 4% and 25% on cost\nMotor vehicles\n-\n25% on cost\nThe company has reviewed its tangible assets, which comprise land, buildings and initial fixtures and fittings. Where the\ndirectors consider that the expected useful life is in excess of 50 years and the carrying value in the financial statements is\nnot more than the estimated recoverable amount, no depreciation is charged and, in accordance with FRS11, the directors\nhave and will continue to carry out annual reviews of impairment. The review is based on the directors’ assessments of the\nmarket value and the future economic benefit derived from an asset versus its carrying value in the accounts. Impairment\ncharges are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nk. Investments\nInvestments are carried at market value in accordance with the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and The\nStatement of Recommended Practice ‘Accounting and Reporting by Charities’.\nRealised gains are the difference between sales proceeds and opening market value where the investment was held at the\nbeginning of the year, or sales proceeds less cost of purchase where the investment was acquired in the year.\nUnrealised gains are the change in value of investments after taking into account any movements in investment holdings such\nas purchases and disposals of investments. The revaluation reserve reflects the accumulated total of unrealised gains.\nUninvested cash is the balance of liquid cash, held as an investment, which has not been invested in securities.\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n28\nInvestments (Continued)\nRealised and unrealised gains are accounted for within the SOFAs on pages 21 and 22.\nl. Stocks\nStocks comprise raw materials, consumable stores and goods held for resale: they are valued at the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value.\nm. Leasing Commitments\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over\ntheir useful lives or the period of the lease whichever is the shorter. The interest element of the obligations is charged to\nthe SOFA over the period of the lease. Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks\nof ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the SOFA on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nn. Fund Accounts\nEndowment funds are subject to specific conditions by donors that the capital must be maintained by the charity.\nRestricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. The purposes and uses of the\nrestricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\nDesignated funds comprise funds which have been set aside at the discretion of the directors for specific purposes. The\npurposes and uses of the designated funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\no. Taxation\nHurstpierpoint College Limited is a registered charity and as such is exempt from income tax and corporation tax under the\nprovisions of Section 478 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. There is no similar exemption for VAT, which is included in\nexpenditure or in the cost of assets as appropriate.\nThe School has subsidiary companies that are subject to taxes including corporation tax and VAT in the same way as any\ncommercial organisation. The tax charged to the profit and loss accounts is based on the subsidiary companies’ profits for\nthe year and takes into account tax arising because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and\naccounting purposes. The subsidiary companies pay over the majority of their profits to Hurstpierpoint College Limited\nunder Gift Aid and tax liabilities are kept to a minimum.\np. Cash flow statement\nThe cash flows of Hurstpierpoint College Limited are included in the consolidated cash flow statement of The Woodard\nCorporation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised) from publishing a cash flow\nstatement.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n29\n2.

PENSION SCHEMES\nTeachers’ Pension Scheme\nThe School participates in the Teachers' Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (""the TPS"") for its teaching staff. This is\na multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate to consistently identify the\nliabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the School. As required by FRS17 ""Retirement Benefits"", the School\naccounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe pension charge for the year includes contributions payable to the TPS of £770,932 (2014: £711,151) and at the\nyear-end £63,448 (2014 - £57,141) was accrued in respect of contributions to this scheme.\nThe TPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme governed by the Teachers' Pension Scheme\nRegulations 2014. Membership is automatic for teachers, although they are able to opt out. Members contribute on a\n""pay as you go"" basis with contributions from members and the employer being credited to the Exchequer. Retirement\nand other pension benefits are paid by public funds provided by Parliament.\nThe employer contribution rate is set following scheme valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary Department.\nThe latest valuation report in respect of the TPS was prepared at 31 March 2012 and was published in June 2014. This\nreport confirmed that the employer contribution rate for the TPS will increase from 14.1% to 16.4% although,\nrecognising that teaching establishments work on an academic and not financial year, the Government has deferred the\nimplementation of this increase to 1 September 2015. Employers will in addition from 1 September 2015 pay a scheme\nadministration levy of 0.08% of the employers' salary costs which will increase the total employer payment rate from\n16.4% to 16.48%.\nThe next revision to the employer contribution rate is not expected to take effect until 1 April 2019. This will follow\non from the next actuarial valuation which is due at 31 March 2016. This valuation will also determine the opening\nbalance of the cost cap fund and provide an analysis of the cost cap as required by the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.\nA copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation is on the Teachers’ Pensions website.\nPensions Trust’s Growth Plan\nThe company participates in The Pensions Trust’s Growth Plan (the Plan). The Plan is funded and is not contracted-\nout of the State scheme. The Plan is a multi-employer pension plan. Contributions paid into the Plan up to and including\nSeptember 2001 were converted to defined amounts of pension payable from Normal Retirement Date. From October\n2001 contributions were invested in personal funds which have a capital guarantee and which are converted to pension\non retirement, either within the Plan or by the purchase of an annuity.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n41\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nThe rules of the Plan allow for the declaration of bonuses and/or investment credits if this is within the financial capacity\nof the Plan assessed on a prudent basis. Bonuses/investment credits are not guaranteed and are declared at the\ndiscretion of the Plan’s Trustee.\nThe Trustee commissions an actuarial valuation of the Plan every three years. The purpose of the actuarial valuation is\nto determine the funding position of the Plan by comparing the assets with the past service liabilities as at the valuation\ndate. Asset values are calculated by reference to market levels. Accrued past service liabilities are valued by discounting\nexpected future benefit payments using a discount rate calculated by reference to the expected future investment\nreturns.\nThe rules of the Plan give the Trustee the power to require employers to pay additional contributions in order to\nensure that the statutory funding objective under the Pensions Act 2004 is met. The statutory funding objective is that\na pension scheme should have sufficient assets to meet its past service liabilities, known as Technical Provisions.\nIf the actuarial valuation reveals a deficit, the Trustee will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit over a specified\nperiod of time either by way of additional contributions from employers, investment returns or a combination of these.\nThe rules of the Plan state that the proportion of obligatory contributions to be borne by the member and the member’s\nemployer shall be determined by agreement between them. Such agreement shall require the employer to pay part of\nsuch contributions and may provide that the employer shall pay the whole of them. The Company paid contributions\nat rates of either 6% or 10%, and members paid contributions at rates of either 3% or 5% during the accounting period.\nAs at the balance sheet date there were 125 active members of the Plan employed by the Company. The Company\ncontinues to offer membership of the Plan to its employees.\nIt is not possible in the normal course of events to identify on a reasonable and consistent basis the share of underlying\nassets and liabilities belonging to individual participating employers. The Plan is a multi-employer scheme, where the\nassets are co-mingled for investment purposes, and benefits are paid out of the Plan’s total assets. Accordingly, due to\nthe nature of the Plan, the accounting charge for the period under FRS17 represents the employer contribution payable.\nThe valuation results at 30 September 2011 were completed in 2012 and have been formalised. The valuation of the\nPlan was performed by a professionally qualified Actuary using the Projected Unit Method. The market value of the\nPlan’s assets at the valuation date was £780 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e . past service liabilities) were\n£928 million. The valuation therefore revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of liabilities of £148 million,\nequivalent to a funding level of 84%.\nThe financial assumptions underlying the valuation as at 30 September 2011 were as follows:\n% per annum\nRate of return pre-retirement\n4.9\nRate of return post retirement:\nActive/Deferred\nPensioners\n4.2\n4.2\nBonuses on accrued benefits\n0.0\nInflation: Retail Price Index (RPI)\n2.9\nInflation: Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n2.4\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n42\nIn determining the investment return assumptions the Trustee considered advice from the Scheme Actuary relating to\nthe probability of achieving particular levels of investment return. The Trustee has incorporated an element of prudence\ninto the pre and post retirement investment return assumptions; such that there is a 60% expectation that the return\nwill be in excess of that assumed and a 40% chance that the return will be lower than that assumed over the next 10\nyears.\nThe Scheme Actuary is currently finalising the 2014 valuation and results will be communicated in due course. At 30\nSeptember 2013, the market value of the Plan’s assets was £772 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e . past\nservice liabilities) was £927 million. The update, therefore, revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of\nliabilities of £155 million, equivalent to a funding level of 83%.\nIf an actuarial valuation reveals a shortfall of assets compared to liabilities, the Trustee must prepare a recovery plan\nsetting out the steps to be taken to make up the shortfall.\nThe Pensions Regulator has the power under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 to issue scheme funding directions where\nit believes that the actuarial valuation assumptions and/or recovery plan are inappropriate. For example, the Regulator\ncould require that the Trustee strengthens the actuarial assumptions (which would increase the Plan liabilities and hence\nimpact on the recovery plan) or impose a schedule of contributions on the Plan (which would effectively amend the\nterms of the recovery plan). A copy of the recovery plan in respect of the September 2011 valuation was forwarded\nto The Pensions Regulator on 2 October 2012, as is required by legislation.\nFollowing a change in legislation in September 2005 there is a potential debt on the employer that could be levied by\nthe Trustee of the Plan, and The Pensions Act 2011 has more recently altered the definition of Series 3 of the Growth\nPlan so that a liability arises to employers from membership of any Series except Series 4. The debt is due in the event\nof the employer ceasing to participate in the Plan or the Plan winding up. The debt for the Plan as a whole is calculated\nby comparing the liabilities for the Plan (calculated on a buy-out basis i.e . the cost of securing benefits by purchasing\nannuity policies from an insurer, plus an allowance for expenses) with the assets of the Plan. If the liabilities exceed\nassets there is a buy-out debt.\nThe leaving employer’s share of the buy-out debt is the proportion of the Plan’s liability attributable to employment\nwith the leaving employer compared to the total amount of the Plan’s liabilities (relating to employment with all the\ncurrently participating employers). The leaving employer’s debt therefore includes a share of any ‘orphan’ liabilities in\nrespect of previously participating employers. The amount of the debt therefore depends on many factors including\ntotal Plan liabilities, Plan investment performance, the liabilities in respect of current and former employees of the\nemployer, financial conditions at the time of the cessation event and the insurance buy-out market. The amounts of\ndebt can therefore be volatile over time.\nThe Growth Plan is a “last man standing” multi-employer scheme. This means that if a withdrawing employer is unable\nto pay its debt on withdrawal the liability is shared amongst the remaining employers. The participating employers are\ntherefore, jointly and severally liable for the deficit in the Growth Plan. As at 30 September 2013 the total deficit\ncalculated on the buy-out basis was £219.9 million. See note 27 for further details.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n43\n27. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn common with other charities with employees contributing to the Pensions Trust Growth Plan, the Company has\nbeen informed of potential amounts payable should the Company undertake certain actions, for example significant re-\norganisation, leading to cessation of membership and contributions.\nWhen an employer withdraws from a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme which is in deficit, the employer\nis required by law to pay its share of the deficit, calculated on a statutory basis (known as the buy-out basis), as outlined\nin Note 26. Due to a change in the definition of money purchase contained in the Pensions Act 2011 the calculation\nbasis that applies to the Growth Plan will be amended to include Series 3 liabilities in the calculation of an employer’s\ndebt on withdrawal.\nThe Pensions Act 2011 also proposed regulations which will make “consequential or transitional provisions to avoid\nadverse consequences”. Should an employer withdraw prior to the regulations coming into force (expected to be at\nthe end of July 2014), they should contact The Pensions Trust to check whether the regulations could affect their debt\non withdrawal calculation.\nThe Company has been notified by The Pensions Trust of the estimated employer debt on withdrawal from the Plan\nbased on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 September 2014. As of this date the estimated employer debt for\nthe Company was £607,256, including Series 3 liabilities. These potential liabilities will diminish over time and the\nCompany has no intention to undertake an action which will crystallise the contingent amount.\n28. RELATED PARTIES\nThe Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Woodard Corporation, a registered charity number 1096270, which\nis incorporated in England and Wales.

The Articles permit funds to be managed in such a\nmanner as the directors see fit, provided that such powers are only exercised for the purposes of attaining the objects and\nin a2 manner which is legally charitable. They forbid the distribution of any property and funds, which are to be applied solely\ntowards the promotion of the objects of the Company.\nGoverning Body\nThe Directors of the Company, who are also the trustees of the Charity, together comprise the governing body of\nHurstpierpoint College. Directors are elected to hold office for five years and are eligible to stand for re-election. The\nDirectors who held office during the year are listed on page |. None has any beneficial interest in the Company.\nAll Directors are Corporate Fellows (members) of the Woodard Corporation, and are committed to its charitable objects.\nCorporate Fellows are responsible for electing the Woodard Corporation Board.\nRecruitment and Training of Governors\nGovernors are recruited from a wide range of College contacts and from others in the local community. The governing body\nlooks to ensure a mix of skills, and select new governors on the basis of background, competence, specialist skills and, in the\ncase of Fellows, Christian commitment. Governors are provided with induction training by the Head, Bursar and staff, and a\nwider programme of training events is organised by the Woodard Corporation. The College also arranges training sessions\nand encourages governors to attend seminars run by the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools (AGBIS).\nOrganisational Management\nThe Directors meet as a Council four times each year to determine general policy of the Company and review its overall\nmanagement and control, for which they are legally responsible. The work of implementing the majority of the Council’s\npolicies is delegated to a number of committees, membership of which is outlined on page 1.\nThe Finance Committee has a remit to consider budgets, both revenue and capital, cash flow information and financial\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nreports, including the financial statements. It also considers financial policies and the financial regulations. It makes\nrecommendations to the Council for approval. The Finance Committee met three times during the year.\nThe Education Committee is responsible for oversight of the academic performance of the College and for\neducational policy, making recommendations to the Council.

The\nCommittee met twice during the year.\nThe day to day running of the College is the responsibility of the Head and the Bursar, supported by the Senior Management\nTeam.\nGroup Structure and Relationships\nThe College has three wholly-owned non-charitable subsidiaries, Hurst Facilities Limited, Hurst Transport Limited (formerly\nHurst Tech Ltd) and Hurst International Ltd, the activities and trading of which are described below. Note 28 provides\ndetails of connected charities.\nThe College has developed links with a wide range of organisations to ensure the widest possible access to our facilities and\nschooling. Through membership of HMC and IAPS and through networking with peer groups we ensure that we are able to\nattain the highest standards of quality and performance. We encourage our pupils to develop an awareness of the social\ncontext of the all-round education they receive at the school and they are engaged in a number of activities to enhance their\nunderstanding. We have an alumni group, the Old Johnians, who are generous in supporting the work of the College and\nwhose support we greatly appreciate. We also cooperate with many local charities in our ongoing endeavours to widen\npublic access to the schooling we can provide, to optimise the educational use of our cultural and sporting facilities and to\nawaken in our pupils, in the public interest, an awareness of the social context of the all-round education they receive.\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES\nCharitable Objects\nThe Charity’s objects, as set out in the Memorandum of Association, are to promote and extend education in accordance\nwith the doctrines and principles of the Church of England, through the operation of Hurstpierpoint College. Within these\nObjects, the Charity also has to maintain its heritage endowment, the College with its Grade 2 chapel and listed buildings,\nand also has various endowed and restricted funds held for special purposes in connection with the development of the\nCollege’s facilities as well as for scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other educational purposes.\nIn setting objectives and planning activities the Directors have given careful consideration to the Charity Commission’s general\nguidance on charitable purposes and public benefit, and in particular to its supplementary guidance on the advancement of\neducation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is a charitable trust which seeks to benefit the public through the pursuit of its\nstated aims. Fees are set at a level to ensure the financial viability of the College and at a level that is consistent with the aim\nof providing a first class education to all pupils. The College’s charitable objectives are ‘to promote and extend education’,\nand these objectives are recognised as benefiting the public when pursued in the context of formal education in a body where\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nall surplus funds are re-invested. The Woodard Corporation and all of the schools it owns are charitable bodies, with no\nexternal shareholders and no possibility of making distributions, whether in the form of dividends or otherwise. All surpluses\nare re-invested in education.\nThe College welcomes pupils from all backgrounds. To admit a prospective pupil we need to be satisfied that we will be able\nto educate and develop them to the best of their potential and in line with the general standards achieved by their peers.\nEntrance interviews and assessments are undertaken to satisfy ourselves and parents that potential pupils can cope with the\npace of learning and benefit from the education we provide. An individual’s economic status, gender, ethnicity, race, religion\nor disability do not form any part of our assessment processes.\nThe College is an equal opportunity organisation that is committed to a working environment free from any form of\ndiscrimination, whether on the grounds of colour, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or disability, and we\nmake reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of staff or pupils who are or become disabled.\nCharitable Activities\nThe principal activity of the Charity continues to be the provision of education to pupils ranging from 4 to 18 years of age. It\nalso runs a number of activity sessions during the school holidays which are open to both pupils and non-pupils of the College,\nand the College facilities are available at other times for use by the local community.\nThe College comprises three constituent schools. The Senior School is a boarding and day school for pupils aged 13-18,\nwhilst the Preparatory School (which is a day school) is for pupils aged from 7-13. The Pre-Prep is for 4-7 year-olds.\nThe College provides a very high standard of education and this is validated in review of the academic results, our\nmeasurements of added value and through external inspection. It offers a broad curriculum and educates children with a\nrange of abilities. Our aim is to support children in reaching their potential in all areas of their activity at the College. This\nmay be in academic subjects but can just as easily be reflected in success in art, drama, sport, music or dance. We produce\nwell-rounded individuals who make a positive contribution to society.\nGrant Making\nThe College does not make grants to external bodies.\nSTRATEGIES AND POLICIES SUPPORTING THE CHARITABLE OBJECTS\nPublic Benefit Aims and Intended Impact\nIn order to meet the Charity’s objects, the College aims to create an environment to nurture children, to get the best from\nthem and to allow them to develop and fulfil their full potential. We provide them with a first-class education, independent\nof the maintained sector, and a wide range of sporting, artistic and extra-curricular opportunities, and our over-arching public\nbenefit aim is that all pupils will have the skills, the confidence and the intention to contribute to the wider community.\nIn the furtherance of these aims the Directors, as the Charity trustees, have complied with the duty in s.17 of the Charities\nAct 2011 to have due regard to the Charity Commission’s published general and relevant sub-sector guidance concerning the\noperation of the Public Benefit requirement under that Act.\nWoodard and its schools provide a significant benefit to the public. The College strives to ensure that measures of public\nbenefit are appropriate, and that significant sections of the public are not excluded from the opportunity to benefit from the\neducation and facilities offered due to the need to pay a fee. In addition to significant provision of bursaries and other forms\nof financial support, the College provides a wide range of opportunities for community benefit and facilities and events are\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \noften open to all. Further detail of the public benefit offered is included in the section entitled ‘Review of Achievements and\nPerformance for the Year’ below.\nIt is a key requirement of evidencing public benefit that any private benefit to individuals or elements of the charity will be\nincidental to the charity's objectives. An example of private benefit may be the reimbursement of travelling expenses for\ntrustees attending training courses: any private benefit to individuals or elements of Woodard are incidental to delivery of\nthe charitable objectives.\nStrategic Aims\nThe Directors conducted a review of the College’s long-term strategic plan during the year. There were no significant\nchanges to the College’s long-term strategic aims, which are:\ne  to be the first choice, co-educational, medium-sized, weekly, flexi-boarding and day school for pupils within an hour’s\ndrive who seek a genuinely excellent all round education with a strong academic core;\ne  to maintain and optimise pupil numbers to ensure the long-term viability of the College, to achieve necessary economies\nof scale and to generate sufficient funds to maintain and improve the physical infrastructure of the College;\ne  to continue academic improvement and development, by maintaining and fostering a successful and vibrant academic\nenvironment throughout the College and particularly through the strengthening of the sixth form provision;\n. to develop the facilities to an excellent standard; and\ne to widen public access to our system of schooling as far as possible within the constraints of our funding as an\nindependent education-provider.\nAccess Policy\nIt is important to us that access to the education we offer is not restricted to those who can afford our fees. A great deal of\nlearning occurs through social interaction, conversation and shared experiences, and we believe our pupils benefit from\nlearning within a diverse community where they are able to develop an understanding of the perspectives of other people\nthat will be vital in their adult lives.\nOur various concessions policies, as detailed below, contribute to a widening of access to the education we offer and the\nfacilities we enjoy. These policies are kept under regular review to ensure that able children can accept offers of places at\nthe College regardless of their parental circumstances and means.\nAwards Policy\nThe College is committed to attracting pupils of the highest calibre through scholarships and other awards; and broadening\naccess by offering means-tested financial support in the form of bursaries to eligible parents (or guardians) to assist with the\npayment of the College fees.\nScholarship awards are given for academic potential; for excellence in the fields of music, art, drama, dance and sport; or on\nthe basis of all-round ability. The awards — which are not subject to means testing — involve a fixed remission of fees of\nbetween 5% and 25%. Where further assistance is required, scholarship awards can be supplemented by a means-tested\nbursary. Bursaries — which are available to all holders of scholarship awards and are made solely on the basis of parental\nmeans — are important in helping to ensure that children from families who would otherwise not be able to afford the fees\ncan access the education we offer.\nBursary awards are available for up to 100% of basic fees and additional sums may be provided to meet the cost of extra-\ncurricular activities, equipment and school trips. In addition, bursaries are also available to relieve hardship where a current\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \npupil’s education and future prospects would otherwise be at risk — for example, in the case of redundancy. In assessing\nmeans we use the methodology promulgated by the Independent Schools’ Bursars Association, which takes a number of\nfactors into consideration including family income, assets and savings, as well as family circumstances — for example, dependant\nrelatives and the number of siblings.\nThe College Endowment Fund has been established in order to build an endowment that will be used to provide bursarial\nsupport to talented pupils in future. It is funded by donations from existing parents and transfers from unrestricted funds.\nFor the time being, however, the College does not have a meaningful endowment and in funding our awards we have to be\nmindful that we must ensure a balance between fee-paying parents — many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to\nfund their child’s education — and those benefiting from the awards.\nThe criteria for Awards and the application process are detailed on the College website and in the College’s Scholarship\ninformation booklets which are published annually. The availability of scholarship awards and bursaries is advertised widely\nthroughout the year in the local press and details of the schemes are provided to all parents making enquiries about possible\nentry to the College.\nDetails of bursary and other awards are included in the Strategic Report below and in note 2 to the accounts.\nOther Assistance\nTo underline the value we place on continuity for families, at the beginning of the year we increased the discounts offered to\nparents with more than one child at the College; while as part of our emphasis on attracting and retaining high-calibre staff\nwe continue to offer a discount scheme to members of the teaching staff who choose to educate their children with us.\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nREVIEW OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR\nObjectives for 2014/15\nThis year our primary objectives were to:\ne  Consolidate pupil numbers and maintain the academic standard of students joining Hurst;\ne Restructure the timetable and curriculum provision across the College for September 2015 onwards to allow for the\nrevised GCSE and A level courses and produce a coherent academic journey through the College for every pupil;\ne  Develop the use of data for academic purposes in the Prep and Pre Prep and embed and strengthen the culture of\nlearning across the entire College;\ne  Complete the review of the IT provision at the College, and develop a College-wide strategy for the use of all\ntechnologies in teaching and learning;\ne  Create a development office to help build and support the newly formed Hurst Society, in order to focus and consolidate\nthe activities of our alumni and parental groups; and\ne  Complete the central academic axis at the College by undertaking the final stage of the science block redevelopment\nand constructing a further extension to the classroom block.\nPupil Numbers\nPupil numbers at the College during the year were as follows:\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \n2014/2015 2013/2014\nSenior School 738 (371 boarders) 730 (382 boarders)\nPreparatory School 290 292\nPre-Preparatory School 54 69\nTotal 1,082 (371 boarders) 1,091 (382 boarders)\nThe number of boys and girls educated was as follows:\n2014/2015 2013/2014\nBoys Girls Boys Girls\nSenior School 404 334 400 329\nPreparatory School 151 139 166 127\nPre-Preparatory School 31 23 39 30\nTotal 586 496 605 486\nAchievement of the Year’s Objectives The objectives set for 2014/15 were largely met. Although overall pupil numbers declined slightly, this was principally a result of the decision three years ago to move to\none form entry in the Pre-Prep school and there was a further increase in pupil numbers in the Senior School, which\nwas achieved despite the College setting higher standards for entry at both 13+ and 16+;\nFollowing a detailed review, and in the light of the changes announced by the Government to GCSE and A level courses,\nthe timetable and curriculum provision across the College was revised, to ensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent,\nlinear academic programme;\nThe on-line Grades and Reporting System in use in the Senior School for assessing, reporting and monitoring pupil\nprogress was extended throughout the Prep and Pre-prep schools;\nFollowing a review of the IT provision at the College, the decision was taken to provide all pupils entering year 9 with a\nCollege lap-top and to out-source the IT support function from August 2015;\nWork commenced on two major building projects to complete the central academic axis at the College: the final stage\nof the science block redevelopment, incorporating new science laboratories, a lecture room as well as extended facilities\nfor design technology; and a further extension to the classroom block, including new teaching rooms for drama.\nAcademic Hurst In terms of public examination results, 2014-15 was a highly successful year, with records broken by all three of our external examination year groups. Our A*/B percentage at A level rose for the fourth year in succession so that 77.5% of our A2 results were A*/B grades and 66 A* grades were achieved overall. Altogether thirty eight pupils gained 3As or better, and A* and A grades made up 49.5% of the overall results. Our BTEC Sport class achieved stunning results once more with 100 % Distinctions Starred. One pupil\fHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nachieved 4A*s in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics and Physics whilst another managed to\nobtain a top DI grade in the Philosophy and Theology Pre-U course (alongside 2 A* graded A Levels). When all the UCAS\npoints achieved by our Uéth pupils were counted up, the average score per candidate was 356.0.\nAll those who held provisional Oxbridge or medical offers secured their places, and, in total, 78 students (82% of all those\nproceeding to university this year) went to Russell Group or ex-1994 Group universities to embark on a variety of courses\nranging from Accounting to Veterinary Nursing.\nAt AS level, the class of 2015 saw 29 students achieving three A grades or better, and the highest percentage of A&B grades\never. On results day the statements of results showed 37.6% A grades, with three pupils each having 5 A grades. Seventeen\nstudents gained at least 4 A grades and sixteen had nothing other than A grades on their results statements.\nAt GCSE level, 2015 also brought our highest ever A*/A percentage (66.5%) alongside a record A*/B percentage of 90.6,\nOverall, our fifth form students achieved 423 A* grades, making up 30.9% of our total GCSE grades. Sixty eight pupils gained\n8 or more A* & A grades, while twenty six pupils had only A* and A grades on their statements of results and fourteen had\nIl or more A* & A grades. Our iGCSE results were again very strong with 66.2% of all the grades in biology, chemistry and\nphysics being A* grades and 92.5% being A* & A grades. Individually, one student gained | | A*s and |A grade whilst three\nothers achieved || A* grades, and another thirty three students collected 10 A* & A grades or better. Three students also\nachieved the top grade of A® in Further Mathematics.\nAlongside the existing iPad project, and in response to pupil demand for a more functional resource, we are now\nintroducing a laptop programme to pupils in year 9 of the Senior School. This will provide centrally managed, backed-up\nand monitored devices for pupils and staff to support classroom learning. This will mean every pupil in the Senior School\nwith the exception of Year |13 — many of whom already have their own devices —will be digitally enabled. In the Prep\nSchool, digital tasks continue to be embedded into all areas of the curriculum and, with a number of class sets of iPads in\ncirculation, teachers from Reception through to Year 6 are able to easily incorporate digital learning opportunities into all\nsubjects of the curriculum. As technology becomes a natural and necessary part of every child’s education, so a shift is\noccurring, moving us away from stipulating specific programmes and methods to make use of these digital devices, to\nproviding them and allowing pupils and teachers to utilize them as they see fit to enhance the learning.\nPupil Welfare\nThe College is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of its pupils and expects all staff and volunteers to share\nthis commitment. In the last Independent Schools Inspectorate report, it was recognised that this commitment was given the\nhighest priority, and the quality of the pastoral care at the College was described as excellent. The College has appointed a\nDirector of Safeguarding whose remit is to train all staff and ensure that safeguarding practices and procedures are\nimplemented consistently across the College, and with effect from September 2015 there will be a Deputy Head responsible\nfor all pastoral care in the College.\nParents are given regular information about their children’s social and academic progress through parent evenings, through\nthe College’s innovative challenge grades which are reviewed and reported approximately every four weeks, and through an\nannual report. We also maintain regular contact with parents throughout the year through informal contacts, regular social\nevents organised in houses and for year groups, and regular newsletters. Parents are also invited to attend talks on pastoral\nissues such as on-line safety and mental health.\nAll pupils have a House Parent who is responsible for their pastoral care and a Tutor responsible for their academic\ndevelopment. We also have a system of student guardians who are involved in assisting staff in enforcing our pro-active anti-\nbullying policy, while pupils also have confidential access to professional Counsellors who visit the school weekly. In addition,\nmedical help is on hand at the College’s Medical Centre.\nThe College runs a Student Council so that concerns of the pupil body can be raised and voiced, and these are taken to the\nHouse Parents’ meeting which is attended by members of the Senior Management Team. In addition, the College Prefects\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nhave a weekly meeting where welfare concerns are also raised.\nCreative Hurst\nThe main focus for the dance department this year was to present performances in a variety of venues and with different\nstarting points to avoid predictability. The annual Dance Showcase was ‘Retrograde’, which celebrated 10 years of dance at\nHurst, involving dances performed over the past |0 years by all three schools, along with new material and as an added\ndimension and, for the first time, a couple of former pupils returned to perform the dances they had originally done when\nat the College. The dance department also collaborated on the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. The number of boys\nparticipating in extra-curricular dance and opting for GCSE dance is increasing and there are now a number of different\ndance companies, all of whom have residential workshops or perform outside of the College. Dance in the Prep and Pre-\nprep schools continues to develop, with a number of pupils taking ballet exams and several after-school dance activities,\nincluding the popular boys’ street dance.\nThe Music Department was busy as always. It contributed again to the Hurst Festival, providing a concert in the village and\nan afternoon’s entertainment with tea and cake in the College itself. The house music competition involved everybody in\nthe Senior School singing with their respective houses, while the size of the choir has increased again and is now [ 40-strong.\nThe choir sang at every chapel service and excelled particularly in the candle-lit advent procession, the festival of 9 lessons\nand carols, and the leavers’ service. The Chamber choir sang carols to the elderly at a variety of locations in and around\nthe village and was once again the choir in residence at the Walsingham National Pilgrimage.\nA choral day for visiting Prep schools led by the director of music was popular and the final concert was a great success, as\nwas the concert given by the choral society of parents and friends concert which was accompanied by a professional\norchestra. The jazz and rock concert and ‘Hurst unplugged’ were well attended, successful events, giving both bands and\nsolo acts a great performance opportunity, while the Jazz band gave successful concerts to the U3A and at the United\nReformed Church in Burgess Hill. With the retirement of Derick Austin, this year’s ‘Hurst n’Brie’ was devoted to bands\nand past pupils that had been taught by him. As always, this concert was very successful and a great way to round off the\nacademic year.\nIndividually our pupils achieved success in the annual Mid-Sussex music festival and in our own solo music competition.\nNow established as an annual event, the upper sixth formers performed concerto movements accompanied by a\nprofessional orchestra. There are now record numbers of pupils at the College who have achieved grade 8, and a number\ncurrently play in the Brighton Youth and the South Downs’ Youth Orchestras.\nPrep school music remained very strong with a full calendar of events throughout the year. Highlights included the winter\nconcert showcasing the various orchestras and ensembles, the Jazz concert in the Lent term, the outdoor summer concert\nand, particularly, a successful choir tour to Amsterdam.\nFinally, we were delighted to welcome back an old boy, Richard Hadfield, as a member of the 2014 Britain’s Got Talent\nwinners, Collabro who used the Bury Theatre as a venue for their dress rehearsal prior to a national tour. Tickets for the\nconcert were sold out within half an hour and the proceeds will be used for supporting future overseas tours by the music,\ndrama and sport departments.\nThis Art and Photography Department started this year with an exhibition of old books transformed into artwork which\nshowed a stunning level of skill and commitment by students. This set the standard for the rest of the year and the three\ntermly art shows were the best yet. Pupils visited a number of galleries, including Kew, Jerwood, the Royal Academy, the\nNational Gallery and the Tate, while the AS visited the Biennale art show in Venice. The year culminated with a brilliant set\nof exam results for all years, including A*-B grades in GCSE art, 79% A-B in AS art and photography, and 75% A*-B grades at\nA2 in art and photography.\nIn drama, there was a huge range of diverse theatre trips, workshops and showcase performances. The College staged over\n20 productions during the year, |10 students being involved in productions in the Michaelmas term alone. We again\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nparticipated in the local arts festival, the Hurst Festival, and this year 10 fifth form drama scholars performed ‘Grandfathers’\nby Rory Mullarkey. The College has been performing Shakespeare plays annually at the College since 1854 and this year’s\noffering was ‘Twelfth Night’, which had a cast predominately comprising Shell drama scholars and was directed by the\nCollege’s Playwright in Residence. In addition, an Upper Sixth former, Horatio Gould, wrote and directed his second play,\n‘Rex’, and Hurst in Rep incorporated a series of six plays directed by the two gap students and four Sixth formers, one of\nwhom also wrote one of the plays. The major showpiece event of the year was the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. Owing\nto the unprecedented demand for roles, the decision was taken to cast only year 10 students and above, but even so the cast\nstill numbered over 60. This was an excellent show with strong leads and a hired-in set.\nAlso in the Lent term the annual house film competition took place, with each house producing their own films, written and\ndirected by members of the house and supported by a professional production company, followed by a pre-screening in a\nlocal cinema. During the summer term sixth form students appeared in a stunning version of Steven Berkoff's ‘Kvetch’, in\nMartin Crimp’s’ ‘Attempts On Her Life’ and Odon von Horath’s ‘Don Juan Comes back From The War’. There were also\ntwo major productions exclusively for Year 9 students, including the annual Shell Shakespeare Festival and the musical ‘Fame’,\nwhich gave a large number of junior pupils the opportunity to take lead roles and to be trained in the levels of discipline\nnecessary for the main school musical when they are older. In addition, the lower sixth form drama scholars this year\nshowcased the work of a female playwright, Caryl Churchill, while the upper sixth form leavers rounded off the year with a\nperformance of Disney’s ‘Aladdin’.\nIn the Prep school, the year 7/8 production in the Michaelmas term was Disney’s ‘Beauty and the Beast’ which had a huge\ncast. The year 5/6 production also involved over 80 pupils and was a musical version of Oliver, called ‘Olivia’ while the year\n3/4 production at the end of the summer term was ‘The Selfish Giant’. Both these performances were held in the new Moore\nHall, were superbly acted and hugely enjoyable. In addition to these main productions there was the annual Nativity play for\nyears 3/4, a ‘play in a day’, the LAMDA showcase, the Scholars’ performance (the Basil the Rat episode from Fawlty Towers)\nand a drama activity performance, while on an individual level over 80 children took LAMDA exams with well over half\nachieving distinctions.\nSporting Hurst\n2014/15 was probably one of the most rewarding and successful years for sport at the College in recent times and this was\nreflected in the results of the various sporting teams both at the elite and participation levels. In line with this success, the\nCollege continues to develop its sporting programme and profile and the recent opening of a new gym will assist this further.\nIn line with the increased number of pupils at the College, we are running more sports and more teams than ever, and our\nmajor sports of rugby, hockey, netball, cricket and athletics continue to flourish.\nRugby dominates the Michaelmas term programme for boys and we are still developing our fixture list which now sees us\nplaying stronger schools across the South East and whilst the take-up for the sport is good the College must continue to\nencourage boys to participate in order to match the ever more competitive nature of the list. The College’s Ul3s, Ul4s and\nUlés were all crowned county champions this year and the Ist XV reached the last 32 in the NatWest Vase national\ncompetition, whilst on an individual level Hurst continues to supple a steady stream of players to the county age group sides\nand also to the Harlequins academy. The College is also an official RFU Coach Education Centre, holding a variety of courses\nfor coaches and referees, and we regularly host County teams. Seven-a side rugby is also growing in stature, and we entered\nteams in 6 tournaments last year.\nThe Schools hockey has gone from strength to strength over the last few years, particularly since the opening of our second\nAstro pitch. The boys |st Xl came third in the National Hockey Competition at the Lee Valley stadium, which was a fantastic\nachievement for this group, many of whom had come all the way through our Prep school, and from Boys U 14D up to Ist\nXl the College won 79% of all games played. We are now consistently competing at the top level both indoors and outdoors\nand we had 9 boys attending the Junior Regional Performance Centre, 4 on the AASE programme and 3 playing for England\nUl7s. Of the girls, 10 attended at JRPC this year, 2 were on the AASE programme and | played for England U17s. With\n10\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nmore clubs and academies now training at the school after hours, the pupils at all levels get a chance to be part of a club or\ndevelopment academy to further their hockey skills. The College also hosts training and home games for Sussex hockey and\nis now seen as a hub for hockey in the county, and with a number of coaches employed full time, a player welfare team and\nan sports and conditioning coach we are looking to give the pupils every opportunity to improve and perform at all levels.\nNetball also had an outstanding year, which cements Hurst’s reputation as the school to beat both within the county and\nbeyond and we have a number of players in the Sussex Netball Academies. Our Ul5s were SISNA winners and runners up\nin the Sussex Knock-Out Cup. The Ist VIl were runners up at both SISNA and the Sussex Knock Out Cup, while the 16As\nhad a fantastic season, qualifying for the regional round of National Schools and winning both SISNA and the Sussex Knock\nOut Cup. The Ul3s also became county champions.\nCricket at the College has never been stronger and the College did not lose a block fixture against another school last\nsummer. The Ist XI were national champions at T20 as well as winning the Langdale Trophy as Sussex Under 18 T20 Cup\nwinners and the Woodard Schools Trophy. The College continues to have strong links with Sussex CCC and this year will\nhave three players in the Sussex Academy. Three boys gained national caps, for England U19, England U17 and the Dutch\nNational side, while a fourth was named in the team of the tournament for a recent ICC T20 Word Cup qualifying tournament.\nThe minor sports programme is also expanding, with football and triathlon attracting more pupils, and regular competitive\nfixtures. Girls’ cricket now has three teams, with the UI5A team winning the Sussex Softball Competition, while girls’ tennis\nnow comprises eight squads. Boys and girls athletics has always been strong at Hurst and we continue to be a major player\nin Sussex with a substantial medal haul and county representation. Add to this squash, aerobics, polo, gymnastics, sailing, golf,\nrounders and swimming, and it is evident that the College has a strong and diverse sports programme.\nSport in the Prep School also continued to flourish at all levels.\nIn boys' sport, the senior football teams were particularly successful and the rugby results were also good with several boys\nalso playing club rugby and one player involved with Harlequins academy. The U3 boys won the rugby County Cup final,\nbut the strength and depth of our teams is something we continue to pride ourselves on, and the football season saw every\nboy in the school play for a team with some fine results against tough opposition. The hockey teams also performed well in\nseveral tournaments and the U3 boys were crowned County Champions, while cricket remains a strength with a number\nof boys playing club and representative cricket in the County.\nGirls' hockey has been going from strength to strength, having benefitted particularly from a number of our specialist hockey\ncoaches working with the children, and the U13s were County Champions in the | |-a-side game. Netball in the school also\ncontinued to develop well, and during the year we hosted our fourth ‘Hocnet’ tournament including competitive hockey and\nnetball skills alongside short matches, which was very well received. The Ul | netball team qualified for the national IAPS\nfinal, a first for Hurst, and although the U3 team just missed out on qualifying they ended the season by winning the Sussex\nKnockout Cup. Rounders remains popular in the summer, but we also had numerous cricket fixtures with many girls\nparticipating, and this is a growing sport for girls across the college.\nMinor sports such as tennis, athletics, swimming and cross country were all well represented with swimming proving\nparticularly popular. Over 80 pupils also took part in the Athletics after-school club and a number represented Sussex at the\nIAPS Nationals, while the school Triathlon has become a well-established event with many children volunteering to take part\nin one of the three events in the year. In addition, the Prep school again hosted a schools’ show-jumping event at Hickstead\nand entered several teams with great success, while orienteering is again on the school calendar with many children enjoying\nthe challenges of this activity, both on and off campus.\nActivity Hurst\nOutdoor Education forms a significant part of the timetable across the whole School, with activities enriching the wider\nexperiences of pupils in all years.\n11\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nOutdoor pursuits are a regular part of the games programme and an established part of our provision for all year groups,\nwith opportunities to participate in sailing, kayaking, climbing and mountain biking. This year wakeboard, wind sailing and\nsurfing trips were also offered and we held our first wakeboard competition against another school. The increase in numbers\nhas led to greater competitive success, with Hurst again winning the Independent 2014/15 Schools Ski Championships,\nincluding three individual Gold medals. The College team also came second in the 2014 Independent School Climbing\nChampionships, with a Hurst pupil winning individual Gold.\nThis year some 340 pupils were enrolled on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. There were 64 Gold enrolments, and 38\nstudents successfully completed the Gold award with another 16 expected to complete the expedition by the end of the\nyear. The success rate at silver was also impressive, with over three quarters of participants gaining the award by the end of\nthe lower sixth. In addition, the College continued to offer training sessions to the county and to local schools in the web-\nbased pupil registration and recording system for DoE award participants.\nThe weekly Duke of Edinburgh service afternoon — and especially the Combined Cadet Force — continues to increase in\npopularity, allowing pupils to broaden their horizons through volunteering, leadership and self-reliance. In addition, the BTEC\nlevel 2 in Public Services has been a particular success, with 18 students gaining a distinction or merit. During the year there\nwere a number of other community schemes — including recycling, woodland conservation, farming, community service and\nthe College’s in house Créche — and these projects are now both well-established and worthwhile, with nearly 200 students\ninvolved. The year also saw students in the UVI return to their community project on a wholly voluntary basis outside their\nCollege commitment.\nThe year 9 and 10 activity programme, which includes self-defence, farming skills, kayaking, fencing and shooting, adds a further\ndimension to the rich and rounded education received by all pupils at Hurst, and the annual Shell multi-activity day and the\nLower Sixth leadership induction day contribute greatly to the development of pupils’ team building skills and their\nunderstanding of leadership and management.\nThe Prep School activity programme also continued to offer a wide range of options. Children in Year 8 took part in the\nannual Leavers’ Challenge which involved walking part of the South Downs Way in small groups and participating in an\nadventure activity day on route. There was also a ski trip for children in Years 5-8, French trips for pupils in years 5 and 6,\nan activity trip to Snowdonia for Year 8 pupils and an outdoor activity day for the Year 5 students. There is also a weekly\nactivity programme including kayaking, climbing and orienteering for those children who prefer not to play rugby.\nBursaries and Scholarships\nThe College aims to provide opportunities for a wide range of people, particularly those in need, to access benefits from the\nCharity and the College Endowment Fund was established in 2003 in order to accumulate funds which will be used to provide\nfinancial support to talented pupils whose family circumstances would otherwise prevent them from attending the College.\nThe intention is to build up a substantial fund over the years ahead with income earned being utilised to provide means-tested\nbursaries whilst the capital value of the fund is maintained or increased, although this would not preclude the use of capital\nat any time to provide financial support to qualifying pupils. The value of the Endowment Fund is £1.25M.\nWhilst the Endowment Fund is essentially for the future, during the year the College provided scholarships, bursaries and\nother awards exceeding £2.8M to pupils at the College from unrestricted funds. This included means-tested bursaries with\na total value of £561,000 to 59 children both to supplement scholarship awards and in cases of hardship where the pupil’s\neducation and future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Six pupils received assistance (comprising scholarships, external\ngrants and bursaries) for 100% of fees and eight others received assistance for at least 80% of fees.\nScholarships are used to ensure that we are able to maintain high standards in all areas at the College. The total value of\nscholarships awarded in the year was £1.4M. The progress of pupils receiving scholarships is reviewed at least annually to\nensure their progress is in line with their abilities. One scholarship was withdrawn in the year as a result of reviews.\nThe concessions provided by the College represented 12.9% of gross fee income.\n12\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nWider Education\nHurst remains committed to the development of excellence in the classroom, not only within the confines of the College but\nusing its expertise to reach out into the wider profession to support our colleagues in both the maintained and private sectors\nof education.\nThe College continues to value the relationship that it has with its partnership Schools in the Inspire Teaching School Alliance.\nInspire is a group of like-minded schools working in partnership with two local universities to provide teachers with the skills\nand experience to become outstanding practitioners at any stage in their career. The Alliance has a particular focus on\nSchools Direct as a pathway into the teaching profession and in January 2015 Hurst organised and hosted a very successful\ntraining day for all of the School Direct trainees. We were also able to offer a second placement to one of the primary\ntrainees. Several of our staff are members of the various strategic committees within the Alliance.\nOur record for offering training to new and aspiring members of the profession continues to grow. The year saw 8 Newly\nQualified Teachers successfully complete their induction year under the umbrella of the Independent Schools Teacher\nInduction Panel. In February ISTIP inspected our NQT provision and judged the induction policy as excellent, with all NQTs\ndeemed to be focussed, engaged, and feeling very well supported. Alongside the NQTs, the College also committed to fully-\nfunding the Buckingham University PGCE course for two members of staff. The College also employed a number of\nunqualified junior teachers, whose development was supported through one-to-one mentoring, observations and INSET.\nStrong links remain between Hurst and Brighton University, from whom we receive PCGE students for either their first or\nsecond placements. Last year we were able to offer 3 placements across Art, Geography and Dance. Alongside our other\ntrainee teachers, all PGCE placement students are offered a programme of targeted INSET to further develop their practice.\nIn June, the Head of Geography hosted a forum for Geography Heads from the ‘14Group’ of schools, providing an opportunity\nto share best practice and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the forthcoming GCSE and ‘A’ level curriculum\nchanges.\nCommunity Hurst\nThe College is a part of a wider community and we are keen that our staff and pupils participate.\nIn 2015 the College was again actively involved in the local Arts Festival, staging Hurst productions as well as offering facilities,\nvehicles and equipment for festival use; and it also supported numerous local community service activities. In addition, links\nhave been formed with Warden Park, a local maintained school, and we have supported a number of joint ventures with this\nschool.\nBy developing and providing public access to new facilities, the College remains at the heart of the community. Facilities made\navailable to the public include:\nOur sports facilities, which are recognised as being of particular quality and are regularly used by numerous clubs and\norganisations including Brighton & Hove Albion FC (including Sussex Seagulls), Burgess Hill Football Club, Burgess Hill\nTown Ladies FC, Ditchling Cricket Club, Ditchling RFC, England Hockey, First Class Cricket Coaching, Headliners\nCricket, Henfield Cricket Club, Horsham Cricket & Sports Club, Hurst Colts, Hurstpierpoint Cricket Club, Hurst\nHornets FC, Hurstpierpoint Ladies Football Club, Hurstpierpoint Tennis Club, Hurstpierpoint Womens Cricket Club,\nKeymer and Hassocks Cricket Club, Mid Sussex Hockey Club, Mid Sussex Netball Club, Pure Cricket Academy, the\nRugby Football Union, St Andrew's Cricket Club, Sussex Bujin Kan (martial arts training), Sussex County Cricket Club,\nSussex County Hockey, Sussex County Netball Association, Sussex County Rugby, Sussex Martlets cricket, Sussex Netball\nClub, Sussex Nomads cycling club, Sussex RFU, Top Hats and Tutus dance club and Twineham & Wineham Cricket Club.\nThe College minibus fleet, which has been used to support the Brighton Marathon, the Longines Royal International Horse\nShow and also provided ad hoc assistance to Brighton 29th Scout Troop, Lindfield Boys Brigade, Lindfield Primary School,\nLindfield URC youth group, Southwater Scout Troop and Sussex County Netball Club.\n13\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nThe College swimming pool, which is made available to local swimming clubs and organised bodies including Ist Swim\nSchool, Floaters Sports Management, Flippers and Fins, Southdown Lifesavers and Simply Swim.\nOur Chapel, which is open to the public during all services.\nSussex Pages Ltd, a business networking organisation held an event in the dining hall\nThe College grounds, which were made available to Woodlands Meed School for a sponsored walk\nThe sports hall and other facilities, which are used by the Sussex Guild, a self-help organisation for professional designers\nand makers of fine contemporary and traditional craftwork, for their major area show.\nIn addition, during school holiday periods, College facilities were made available to Sussex Police for dog team training and\nfor training sessions run by West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.\nWe also run a choral society for parents and members of the local community; and the College and Prep School Jazz Bands,\nChoirs and other groups regularly perform at charity and fund-raising events across the locality; while numerous arts events\nat the College — including plays, concerts and dance performances — are open to the public.\nWider Charitable Activity\nAs well as supporting the local community through community service activities — including conservation, helping in old\npeople’s homes and youth residential centres — the College community takes part in a wide range of sponsored events and\nother fundraising activities. During the year, through the efforts of pupils, parents and staff, the College raised over £27,000\nfor various charities.\nIn addition to this a team of Senior School pupils raised funds for the building of a school building in a remote village in Malawi.\nThey also raised funds for their own expenses and went to the location to help with its construction. In June all the Senior\nSchool pupils spent a day on various projects in the local area helping charitable and educational causes.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW AND RESULTS FOR 2014/15\nIn financial terms 2014/15 was another very successful year. Net fee income rose by modest 2.0% as a result of a the slight\ndecline in pupil numbers, an increase in fee concessions and fee increases of 3% — once again below the increases imposed by\nmany of our competitors.\nCosts were generally well contained, although these were inflated by a number of factors, primarily increased spending on\nteachers’ salaries, IT and transport, and overall resources expended increased by 2.7%, slightly ahead of the 1.8% increase in\nincoming resources. Expenditure on discretionary building projects fell by 53% to £532,000, as financial resources were\nretained for the two major capital projects which started in early 2015.\nAs a consequence of this and aided by a further £510,000 income from Activities for Generating Funds — primarily income\nfrom lettings — net incoming resources remained extremely positive at £2.42M, only slightly down on the previous year’s high.\nAs a result, operating cash-flow was once again extremely positive and sufficient to fund further capital expenditure of £3.09M\nduring the year.\nOur main trading Company, Hurst Facilities Limited, continues to hire out College facilities during vacations and school hours,\nas well as undertaking commercial activity on behalf of the school and externally (although the main educational letting is\nundertaken by the charity itself). The Company contributed the sum of £33,000 to the College’s operating surplus in 2014/15.\nThe parents of our pupils often make significant sacrifices to pay the fees. In doing so they help to relieve the state of the\nfinancial burden of educating over 1,000 UK-based children. This saving to the state is estimated to have a value in the last\nyear of £6.3M.\n14\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nThe school is unable to recover the VAT on purchases it makes. During the past year, the College has paid an estimated\n£1.45M in VAT on goods and services.\nDevelopment of the College Estate\nOver the year expenditure on improvements to College facilities totalled a further £3.26M: including £1.3M on the extension\nto the science block; £1.0M on the extension to the classroom block; £186,000 on repairs to the College’s original listed\nbuildings (the latest phase of an on-going programme); £200,000 on facilities to accommodate the Colleges Estates teams;\n£101,000 on a new gymnasium; over £130,000 on improvements to boarding houses and £76,000 on improvements to the\nCollege’s historic cricket pavilion.\nInvestment Performance Against Objectives\nThe Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association permit funds to be invested in such manner as the directors see\nfit, provided that such powers of investment are only exercised for the purpose of attaining the objects and in a manner that\nis legally charitable. The governing body’s policy is to preserve the capital value of investments and maximise the return on\nall investments.\nThe College’s investments are managed by UBS Wealth Management and in the opinion of the advisers the performance has\nbeen satisfactory. The investment performance is measured against targets provided by our investment advisers. Stock\nmarket conditions showed a continued improvement over the course of the year and the investment return on the College’s\nfunds, which are now held in the UBS Resolution Income Fund, for the 12 months to 31 August 2015 was 7.81% compared\nwith the benchmark performance target return of 9.14%.\nReserves Policy\nIn common with most independent schools, the Charity’s unrestricted reserves are primarily invested in tangible fixed assets,\nwhich are all used for its direct charitable activities. This utilisation of funds is essential to ensure that high quality up-to-date\nfacilities are available for the benefit of pupils and in order to meet the increasing expectations of our parents. The Directors\nconsider that given the strength of the company’s balance sheet, the stable cash flow from full student rolls, the ongoing\npopularity of the College, and the available banking facility that can be called upon if need arises, there is no need to build up\na free reserve.\nFUTURE PLANS\nStrategic Objectives\nThe Board’s strategic plan was approved in early September 2014 and is reviewed on an annual basis. The key objectives of\nthe current plan are:\ne  To maintain pupil numbers at the present level for both financial as well as educational reasons;\ne  To raise academic standards and create a successful and vibrant academic environment throughout the College and to\nfoster academic entrepreneurship at every level;\ne To recruit high quality pupils to the College;\ne  To strengthen the boarding ethos and maintain the number of boarders at the College by increasing the number and\nstandard of extra-curricular activities and improving the boarding provision;\ne To further develop key facilities across the Campus;\n15\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \nTo widen public access to the College and its resources; and\nTo provide appropriate support to the Woodard Corporation in pursuit of its charitable objectives.\nObjectives for 2015/16 During 2015/16, the College intends to: Complete the revision of the curriculum across the College to accommodate the revised GCSE and A level courses and\nensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent, linear academic programme;\nIntroduce a programme of curricular and extra-curricular activities to foster the academic development of the most able\npupils in the College;\nReview the boarding provision at the College and develop a strategy for its development;\nReview and restructure the College’s marketing activities and branding, including launching an improved website;\nEmbed and extend the provision of mobile technology use in and out of the classroom;\nComplete the development of the central academic axis at the College and plan for the next phase of campus\ndevelopment.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Risk Management The Directors are responsible for the identification and management of risks. Detailed examination of the risks is delegated to the relevant committee, which works with the Senior Management Team to identify risks and establish controls to mitigate them. A formal review of the risk management process and judgements is undertaken annually by the complete governing body. Principal Risks Facing the Charity The principal risks to which the College is exposed include those affecting protection of pupils and security and preservation of charitable assets both now and in the future. Significant risk areas: the market in which the College operates is highly competitive and in order to maintain demand for our services we\nmonitor developments in education to ensure that pupils always receive a first class, holistic and varied educational\nexperience in our school;\nwe strive to ensure that all staff are able to work in a safe and supportive environment and policies, procedures and\ntraining in Human Resource management and Health and Safety help to ensure that the school meets expectations;\nthe College operates in a highly regulated sector, including in matters of safeguarding and child protection, and we\nappoint appropriate staff and professional advisers and utilise the information and support available to us as members of\nvarious constituent associations of the Independent Schools Council to ensure that we are up to date with all current\nrequirements;\nthe College operates in an increasingly litigious environment and we appoint appropriate professional advisers and\npurchase insurance using specialist brokers and advisers to ensure that we can keep up to date with all requirements\nand meet all challenges;\nall organisations face difficult economic conditions, and directors and senior managers in the College keep abreast of\neconomic conditions to identify trends, develop plans to address issues, and to contain costs wherever possible.\n16\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nKey Controls\nThe key controls used by the College include:\ne  formal agendas and minutes for all meetings of the governing body and committees\no terms of reference for all committees\ne comprehensive strategic planning, financial forecasting, budgeting and management accounting\ne  established and identifiable organisational structures and reporting lines\ne comprehensive formal written policies\ne clear authorisation limits\no  safeguarding procedures as required by law and which reflect best practice, for the protection of all our pupils\ne ensuring that all personnel have a fundamental understanding of the need to make the College and its activities a safe\nenvironment for pupils, staff and visitors.\nRisk Management Activities\nThe College plans strategically having regard for risk.

They are drawn up on the historical cost\naccounting basis except that investments held as fixed assets are carried at market value. Financial Reporting Standard 102,\nand a revised Statement of Recommended Practice for Charity Accounting will be applicable for the school’s financial\nstatements ending 31 August 2016.\nGoing Concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors of the charitable Company review the financial\ninformation for the charity and the group, and consider whether the charity and group are going concerns for a period of at\nleast 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable\nexpectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.\nGroup Accounts\nThe financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company, and all its subsidiary companies, charitable\ntrusts and funds with all inter-company balances being eliminated.\nFees and Similar Income\nFees receivable are accounted for in the period in which the service is provided. Fees receivable are stated after deducting\nallowances, scholarships and other remissions granted by the school, but include contributions received from Restricted\nFunds for scholarships, bursaries and other grants. Fees in Advance are those fees received in advance of the following\nyear’s education and are shown as a short term liability until taken to income in accordance with this policy.\nAdvance Fees are those fees received in advance of education to be provided in future years under an Advance Fees Contract\nwhich are held as interest bearing liabilities until either taken to income in the term when used, or else refunded.\nTrading Activity and Ancillary Trading Activity\nIncome from holiday and sports hall lettings are recognised in the SOFA activities when the services are provided.\nDonations and Appeals\nDonations, subject to the specific wishes of the donors, are credited to relevant restricted funds or to endowed funds where\nthe amount is required to be held as permanent capital. Donations received for the general purposes of the school are\ncredited to other unrestricted funds, to distinguish them from direct school income.\n25\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) On occasions the school may set up an appeal to raise finance at times when particular projects are being undertaken.\nMonies received are treated in accordance with the terms of the appeal documentation and are recognised as Designated\nFunds and shown under ‘Unrestricted Funds’ in the SOFA, rather than as Restricted Funds. Appeal documentation explains\nthat monies can be used for general purposes.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings either on a direct cost basis or apportioned according to time spent. The\nirrecoverable element of VAT is included with the item of expense to which it relates.\nThe cost of refurbishing and converting existing buildings is written-off in the year in which it is incurred except where the\nuseful life has been extended. Bad debts are provided for in accordance with the group bad debt policy.\nGovernance Costs\nGovernance costs include the costs attributable to Hurstpierpoint College’s compliance with constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, including audit, strategic management and governors’ meetings and reimbursed expenses. Such costs include\nboth direct and allocated support costs.\nFinance and Other Costs\nOther costs include amounts accrued in accordance with the terms of Advance Fee Contracts.\nPension Costs\nThe Company participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (‘the TPS’), an unfunded Government\nscheme, for its teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate\nto consistently identify the liabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the Company. As required by Financial Reporting\nStandard (‘FRS’) 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company accounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe company offers membership of the Pensions Trust Growth Plan to all the employees other than the full-time academic\nstaff. The Pensions Trust Growth Plan is a multi-employer pension scheme where the scheme assets are pooled for\ninvestment purposes and cannot be attributed to individual employers. Benefits are paid from the total scheme assets. Itis\nin most respects a money purchase arrangement, but has some guarantees. As a result it is not possible or appropriate to\nidentify the assets and liabilities of the scheme which are attributable to the company, though, due to the guarantees inherent\nin the scheme, the companies remain potentially liable for a debt on withdrawal from the scheme. In accordance with FRS\n17 therefore, the scheme is accounted for in a fashion which is similar to a defined contribution scheme. More detail is given\nin notes 26 and 27.\nThe company also contributes to other pension schemes for non-teaching staff.\n26\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Individual capital items, or projects, with a value greater than\n£10,000 are capitalised. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. They are\ntransferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.\nWhere appropriate, cost includes our own labour costs in relation to construction, and directly attributable overheads.\nWhere tangible fixed assets have been acquired with the aid of specific grants they are included in the balance sheet at cost\nand depreciated over their expected useful economic life. The related grants are credited to a restricted fixed asset fund\n(in the statement of financial activities and carried forward in the balance sheet). The depreciation on such assets is charged\nin the statement of financial activities over the expected useful economic life of the related asset on a basis consistent with\nthe depreciation policy.\nDepreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected\nuseful life, as follows:\nFreehold land is not depreciated\nFreehold buildings:\nwith an expected life over 50 years - Nil\nwith an expected life under 50 years -  Variable according to the building and written off over the expected\nuseful life\nunder construction - Nil\nMajor items of plant - 10 years\nComputer equipment - 25% on cost\nFurniture and fittings - 25% on cost\nPlant and equipment - between 4% and 25% on cost\nMotor vehicles - 25% on cost\nThe company has reviewed its tangible assets, which comprise land, buildings and initial fixtures and fittings. Where the\ndirectors consider that the expected useful life is in excess of 50 years and the carrying value in the financial statements is\nnot more than the estimated recoverable amount, no depreciation is charged and, in accordance with FRSI I, the directors\nhave and will continue to carry out annual reviews of impairment. The review is based on the directors’ assessments of the\nmarket value and the future economic benefit derived from an asset versus its carrying value in the accounts. Impairment\ncharges are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nInvestments\nInvestments are carried at market value in accordance with the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and The\nStatement of Recommended Practice ‘Accounting and Reporting by Charities’.\nRealised gains are the difference between sales proceeds and opening market value where the investment was held at the\nbeginning of the year, or sales proceeds less cost of purchase where the investment was acquired in the year.\nUnrealised gains are the change in value of investments after taking into account any movements in investment holdings such\nas purchases and disposals of investments. The revaluation reserve reflects the accumulated total of unrealised gains.\nUninvested cash is the balance of liquid cash, held as an investment, which has not been invested in securities.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 27\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nInvestments (Continued)\nRealised and unrealised gains are accounted for within the SOFAs on pages 21 and 22.\n. Stocks\nStocks comprise raw materials, consumable stores and goods held for resale: they are valued at the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value.\nm. Leasing Commitments\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over\ntheir useful lives or the period of the lease whichever is the shorter. The interest element of the obligations is charged to\nthe SOFA over the period of the lease. Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks\nof ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the SOFA on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nn. Fund Accounts\nEndowment funds are subject to specific conditions by donors that the capital must be maintained by the charity.\nRestricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. The purposes and uses of the\nrestricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\nDesignated funds comprise funds which have been set aside at the discretion of the directors for specific purposes.

This is\na multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate to consistently identify the\nliabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the School. As required by FRSI7 ""Retirement Benefits"", the School\naccounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe pension charge for the year includes contributions payable to the TPS of £770,932 (2014: £711,151) and at the\nyear-end £63,448 (2014 - £57,141) was accrued in respect of contributions to this scheme.\nThe TPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme governed by the Teachers' Pension Scheme\nRegulations 2014. Membership is automatic for teachers, although they are able to opt out. Members contribute on a\n""pay as you go"" basis with contributions from members and the employer being credited to the Exchequer. Retirement\nand other pension benefits are paid by public funds provided by Parliament.\nThe employer contribution rate is set following scheme valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary Department.\nThe latest valuation report in respect of the TPS was prepared at 3|1 March 2012 and was published in June 2014. This\nreport confirmed that the employer contribution rate for the TPS will increase from 14.1% to 16.4% although,\nrecognising that teaching establishments work on an academic and not financial year, the Government has deferred the\nimplementation of this increase to | September 2015. Employers will in addition from | September 2015 pay a scheme\nadministration levy of 0.08% of the employers' salary costs which will increase the total employer payment rate from\n16.4% to 16.48%.\nThe next revision to the employer contribution rate is not expected to take effect until |1 April 2019. This will follow\non from the next actuarial valuation which is due at 31 March 2016. This valuation will also determine the opening\nbalance of the cost cap fund and provide an analysis of the cost cap as required by the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.\nA copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation is on the Teachers’ Pensions website.\nPensions Trust’s Growth Plan\nThe company participates in The Pensions Trust’s Growth Plan (the Plan). The Plan is funded and is not contracted-\nout of the State scheme. The Plan is a multi-employer pension plan. Contributions paid into the Plan up to and including\nSeptember 2001 were converted to defined amounts of pension payable from Normal Retirement Date. From October\n2001 contributions were invested in personal funds which have a capital guarantee and which are converted to pension\non retirement, either within the Plan or by the purchase of an annuity.\n40\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \n26\n26\nPENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nThe rules of the Plan allow for the declaration of bonuses and/or investment credits if this is within the financial capacity\nof the Plan assessed on a prudent basis. Bonuses/investment credits are not guaranteed and are declared at the\ndiscretion of the Plan’s Trustee.\nThe Trustee commissions an actuarial valuation of the Plan every three years. The purpose of the actuarial valuation is\nto determine the funding position of the Plan by comparing the assets with the past service liabilities as at the valuation\ndate. Asset values are calculated by reference to market levels. Accrued past service liabilities are valued by discounting\nexpected future benefit payments using a discount rate calculated by reference to the expected future investment\nreturns.\nThe rules of the Plan give the Trustee the power to require employers to pay additional contributions in order to\nensure that the statutory funding objective under the Pensions Act 2004 is met. The statutory funding objective is that\na pension scheme should have sufficient assets to meet its past service liabilities, known as Technical Provisions.\nIf the actuarial valuation reveals a deficit, the Trustee will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit over a specified\nperiod of time either by way of additional contributions from employers, investment returns or a combination of these.\nThe rules of the Plan state that the proportion of obligatory contributions to be borne by the member and the member’s\nemployer shall be determined by agreement between them. Such agreement shall require the employer to pay part of\nsuch contributions and may provide that the employer shall pay the whole of them. The Company paid contributions\nat rates of either 6% or 10%, and members paid contributions at rates of either 3% or 5% during the accounting period.\nAs at the balance sheet date there were 125 active members of the Plan employed by the Company. The Company\ncontinues to offer membership of the Plan to its employees.\nIt is not possible in the normal course of events to identify on a reasonable and consistent basis the share of underlying\nassets and liabilities belonging to individual participating employers. The Plan is a multi-employer scheme, where the\nassets are co-mingled for investment purposes, and benefits are paid out of the Plan’s total assets. Accordingly, due to\nthe nature of the Plan, the accounting charge for the period under FRS17 represents the employer contribution payable.\nThe valuation results at 30 September 2011 were completed in 2012 and have been formalised. The valuation of the\nPlan was performed by a professionally qualified Actuary using the Projected Unit Method. The market value of the\nPlan’s assets at the valuation date was £780 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e. past service liabilities) were\n£928 million. The valuation therefore revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of liabilities of £148 million,\nequivalent to a funding level of 84%.\nThe financial assumptions underlying the valuation as at 30 September 201 | were as follows:\n% per annum\nRate of return pre-retirement 49\nRate of return post retirement:\nActive/Deferred 4.2\nPensioners 4.2\nBonuses on accrued benefits 0.0\nInflation: Retail Price Index (RPI) 2.9\nInflation: Consumer Price Index (CPI) 24\nPENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\n41\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n \nIn determining the investment return assumptions the Trustee considered advice from the Scheme Actuary relating to\nthe probability of achieving particular levels of investment return. The Trustee has incorporated an element of prudence\ninto the pre and post retirement investment return assumptions; such that there is a 60% expectation that the return\nwill be in excess of that assumed and a 40% chance that the return will be lower than that assumed over the next 10\nyears.\nThe Scheme Actuary is currently finalising the 2014 valuation and results will be communicated in due course. At 30\nSeptember 2013, the market value of the Plan’s assets was £772 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e. past\nservice liabilities) was £927 million. The update, therefore, revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of\nliabilities of £155 million, equivalent to a funding level of 83%.\nIf an actuarial valuation reveals a shortfall of assets compared to liabilities, the Trustee must prepare a recovery plan\nsetting out the steps to be taken to make up the shortfall.\nThe Pensions Regulator has the power under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 to issue scheme funding directions where\nit believes that the actuarial valuation assumptions and/or recovery plan are inappropriate. For example, the Regulator\ncould require that the Trustee strengthens the actuarial assumptions (which would increase the Plan liabilities and hence\nimpact on the recovery plan) or impose a schedule of contributions on the Plan (which would effectively amend the\nterms of the recovery plan). A copy of the recovery plan in respect of the September 2011 valuation was forwarded\nto The Pensions Regulator on 2 October 2012, as is required by legislation.\nFollowing a change in legislation in September 2005 there is a potential debt on the employer that could be levied by\nthe Trustee of the Plan, and The Pensions Act 201 | has more recently altered the definition of Series 3 of the Growth\nPlan so that a liability arises to employers from membership of any Series except Series 4. The debt is due in the event\nof the employer ceasing to participate in the Plan or the Plan winding up. The debt for the Plan as a whole is calculated\nby comparing the liabilities for the Plan (calculated on a buy-out basis i.e. the cost of securing benefits by purchasing\nannuity policies from an insurer, plus an allowance for expenses) with the assets of the Plan. If the liabilities exceed\nassets there is a buy-out debt.\nThe leaving employer’s share of the buy-out debt is the proportion of the Plan’s liability attributable to employment\nwith the leaving employer compared to the total amount of the Plan’s liabilities (relating to employment with all the\ncurrently participating employers). The leaving employer’s debt therefore includes a share of any ‘orphan’ liabilities in\nrespect of previously participating employers. The amount of the debt therefore depends on many factors including\ntotal Plan liabilities, Plan investment performance, the liabilities in respect of current and former employees of the\nemployer, financial conditions at the time of the cessation event and the insurance buy-out market. The amounts of\ndebt can therefore be volatile over time.\nThe Growth Plan is a “last man standing” multi-employer scheme. This means that if a withdrawing employer is unable\nto pay its debt on withdrawal the liability is shared amongst the remaining employers. The participating employers are\ntherefore, jointly and severally liable for the deficit in the Growth Plan. As at 30 September 2013 the total deficit\ncalculated on the buy-out basis was £219.9 million. See note 27 for further details.\n42\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015  \n27. 28. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn common with other charities with employees contributing to the Pensions Trust Growth Plan, the Company has\nbeen informed of potential amounts payable should the Company undertake certain actions, for example significant re-\norganisation, leading to cessation of membership and contributions.\nWhen an employer withdraws from a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme which is in deficit, the employer\nis required by law to pay its share of the deficit, calculated on a statutory basis (known as the buy-out basis), as outlined\nin Note 26. Due to a change in the definition of money purchase contained in the Pensions Act 2011 the calculation\nbasis that applies to the Growth Plan will be amended to include Series 3 liabilities in the calculation of an employer’s\ndebt on withdrawal.\nThe Pensions Act 201 | also proposed regulations which will make “consequential or transitional provisions to avoid\nadverse consequences”. Should an employer withdraw prior to the regulations coming into force (expected to be at\nthe end of July 2014), they should contact The Pensions Trust to check whether the regulations could affect their debt\non withdrawal calculation.\nThe Company has been notified by The Pensions Trust of the estimated employer debt on withdrawal from the Plan\nbased on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 September 2014. As of this date the estimated employer debt for\nthe Company was £607,256, including Series 3 liabilities. These potential liabilities will diminish over time and the\nCompany has no intention to undertake an action which will crystallise the contingent amount.\nRELATED PARTIES\nThe Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Woodard Corporation, a registered charity number 1096270, which\nis incorporated in England and Wales. An amount of £133,621 was paid during the year to the Corporation by way of\na levy to meet Corporation running costs. At the year-end there was an amount outstanding due from the parent\ncompany of £3,116 (2014: Nil).\nThe Company also controls subsidiary trading companies, Hurst Facilities Limited, Hurst International Ltd and Hurst\nTransport Ltd, the results of which are detailed in Notes 3 & 4.\nThe largest and smallest group of undertakings for which group accounts are drawn up is that headed by The Woodard\nCorporation Limited. A copy of these accounts can be obtained from Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff, CFl4\n3UZ.\nThe Company has taken advantage of the exemption which is conferred by Financial Reporting Standard 8, Related Party\nDisclosures, that allows it not to disclose transactions with group undertakings that are eliminated on consolidation.\n43"	"Charity Registration No. 1076498\nCompany Registration No. 3779893 (England and Wales)\nHurst\nHurstpierpoint College\nPre-Prep e Prep Senior School Sixth Form\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n28 November 2015\nHPPC Financial Statements YE310815 Signed\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nCONTENTS\nPage\nDirectors' report:\nCompany information\nI\nReference and Administrative Information\n2\nStructure, Governance and Management\n2\nObjectives and Activities\n3\nStrategic Report\n6\nStatement of Accounting and Reporting Responsibilities\n18\nIndependent auditors' report\n19\nStatutory financial statements of the Company\n21\nNotes to the financial statements\n25\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT: COMPANY INFORMATION\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nDIRECTORS AND ADVISORS\nDirectors\nA Jarvis\nCommittee Membership:\n(Chair)\n/\nFinance Committee\n2\nEducation Committee\nProfessor J P Bacon 2, 5\n3 Estate Committee\nDr S Brydie\n4 Marketing Committee\n5\nP M Dillon-Robinson 3\nGovernance and\nNominations\nR JJ Ebdon I, 3, 5\nF M Hampton /\nM S Harrison I, 5\n(Resigned 5 December 2014)\nRevd JJ B A Joyce 3\nK S Powell 1\nJ P Ruddlesdin 4\nG A Rushton 3\nG J Taysom\nCanon C M A Turnbull 2\nSecretary\nS A Holliday\nCharity No.\n1076498\nCompany No.\n3779893\nPrincipal Address\nHurstpierpoint College\nand\nCollege Lane, Hurstpierpoint\nRegistered Office\nHassocks BN6 9JS\nWebsite\nwww.hppc.co.uk\nKey Management Personnel\nHead\nT JJ Manly\nBursar\nS A Holliday\nHead of Prep School\nI D Pattison\nHead of Sixth Form\nT Firth\nDirector of Studies\nL P Dannatt\nAuditors\nGrant Thornton UK LLP\nGrant Thornton House, Melton Street, Euston Square\nLondon NWI 2EP\nBankers\nBarclays Bank Plc\nI Churchill Place\nLondon E14 5HP\nInvestment Advisers\nUBS Wealth Management (UK) Limited\nI Curzon Street\nLondon WIJ 5UB\nInsurers and Brokers\nZurich Municipal\nMarsh Limited\nThe Zurich Centre, 3000 Parkway\nCapital House, 1-5 Perrymount Road\nWhiteley, Fareham PO15 7JZ\nHaywards Heath RHI6 3SY\nLegal Advisors\nDMH Stallard\nVeale Wasbrough\n100 Queens Road\nOrchard Court Orchard Lane\nBrighton BN 3YB\nBristol BSI 5WS\nSolicitors\nRix & Kay Solicitors LLP\n7 The Drive\nHove BN3 3JS\n1\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nThe directors present their report and financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2015 and confirm they comply with\nthe requirements of the Charities Act 201 and the Charities SORP 2005.\nREFERENCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION\nThe charity, Hurstpierpoint College Limited, (the 'College', 'Charity' or 'Company') was formed in 1849 and is registered\nwith the Charity Commission as charity number 1076498. It was incorporated as a limited liability Company and wholly\nowned subsidiary of The Woodard Corporation (charity number 1096270) in 1999.\nWoodard schools strive for the best all round education of every aspect of each individual; they ensure high standards of\nreligious education; and they see themselves as communities working together for the benefit of all members, and of the\nChurch and the nation. They are strong Christian foundations which adhere to catholic belief as found in the Church, to\nChristian Worship focused in the Eucharist, and to the care of each individual and the whole school community particularised\nin the ministry of the Chaplain.\nSTRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT\nGoverning Document\nThe Company is governed by its Articles of Association, adopted by Special Resolution on 20 March 2013 and replacing those\ndated 6 July 2005 amended by Special Resolution on 25 January 2006. The Articles permit funds to be managed in such a\nmanner as the directors see fit, provided that such powers are only exercised for the purposes of attaining the objects and\nin a manner which is legally charitable. They forbid the distribution of any property and funds, which are to be applied solely\ntowards the promotion of the objects of the Company.\nGoverning Body\nThe Directors of the Company, who are also the trustees of the Charity, together comprise the governing body of\nHurstpierpoint College. Directors are elected to hold office for five years and are eligible to stand for re-election. The\nDirectors who held office during the year are listed on page I. None has any beneficial interest in the Company.\nAll Directors are Corporate Fellows (members) of the Woodard Corporation, and are committed to its charitable objects.\nCorporate Fellows are responsible for electing the Woodard Corporation Board.\nRecruitment and Training of Governors\nGovernors are recruited from a wide range of College contacts and from others in the local community. The governing body\nlooks to ensure a mix of skills, and select new governors on the basis of background, competence, specialist skills and, in the\ncase of Fellows, Christian commitment. Governors are provided with induction training by the Head, Bursar and staff, and a\nwider programme of training events is organised by the Woodard Corporation. The College also arranges training sessions\nand encourages governors to attend seminars run by the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools (AGBIS).\nOrganisational Management\nThe Directors meet as a Council four times each year to determine general policy of the Company and review its overall\nmanagement and control, for which they are legally responsible. The work of implementing the majority of the Council's\npolicies is delegated to a number of committees, membership of which is outlined on page I.\nThe Finance Committee has a remit to consider budgets, both revenue and capital, cash flow information and financial\n2\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nreports, including the financial statements. It also considers financial policies and the financial regulations. It makes\nrecommendations to the Council for approval. The Finance Committee met three times during the year.\nThe Education Committee is responsible for oversight of the academic performance of the College and for\neducational policy, making recommendations to the Council. It met three times during the year.\nThe Estate Committee develops the College's estates strategy, including capital developments and maintenance of\nthe buildings, and it makes recommendations to the Council. It is also responsible for oversight of the College's Health\nand Safety management. It met three times during the year.\nThe Marketing Committee makes recommendations to the Council regarding the promotion of all aspects of the\nCollege, particularly with regards to the successful recruitment of new pupils. It also met three times during the year.\nThe role of the Governance and Nominations Committee is to ensure the Council adheres to the highest\nstandards of internal governance and to consider and propose changes to the membership of the Council. The\nCommittee met twice during the year.\nThe day to day running of the College is the responsibility of the Head and the Bursar, supported by the Senior Management\nTeam.\nGroup Structure and Relationships\nThe College has three wholly-owned non-charitable subsidiaries, Hurst Facilities Limited, Hurst Transport Limited (formerly\nHurst Tech Ltd) and Hurst Internationa Ltd, the activities and trading of which are described below. Note 28 provides\ndetails of connected charities.\nThe College has developed links with a wide range of organisations to ensure the widest possible access to our facilities and\nschooling Through membership of HMC and IAPS and through networking with peer groups we ensure that we are able to\nattain the highest standards of quality and performance. We encourage our pupils to develop an awareness of the social\ncontext of the all-round education they receive at the school and they are engaged in a number of activities to enhance their\nunderstanding. We have an alumni group, the Old Johnians, who are generous in supporting the work of the College and\nwhose support we greatly appreciate. We also cooperate with many local charities in our ongoing endeavours to widen\npublic access to the schooling we can provide, to optimise the educational use of our cultural and sporting facilities and to\nawaken in our pupils, in the public interest, an awareness of the social context of the all-round education they receive.\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES\nCharitable Objects\nThe Charity's objects, as set out in the Memorandum of Association, are to promote and extend education in accordance\nwith the doctrines and principles of the Church of England, through the operation of Hurstpierpoint College. Within these\nObjects, the Charity also has to maintain its heritage endowment, the College with its Grade 2 chapel and listed buildings,\nand also has various endowed and restricted funds held for special purposes in connection with the development of the\nCollege's facilities as well as for scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other educational purposes.\nIn setting objectives and planning activities the Directors have given careful consideration to the Charity Commission's general\nguidance on charitable purposes and public benefit, and in particular to its supplementary guidance on the advancement of\neducation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is a charitable trust which seeks to benefit the public through the pursuit of its\nstated aims. Fees are set at a level to ensure the financial viability of the College and at a level that is consistent with the aim\nof providing a first class education to all pupils. The College's charitable objectives are 'to promote and extend education',\nand these objectives are recognised as benefiting the public when pursued in the context of formal education in a body where\n3\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nall surplus funds are re-invested. The Woodard Corporation and all of the schools it owns are charitable bodies, with no\nexternal shareholders and no possibility of making distributions, whether in the form of dividends or otherwise. All surpluses\nare re-invested in education.\nThe College welcomes pupils from all backgrounds. To admit a prospective pupi we need to be satisfied that we will be able\nto educate and develop them to the best of their potential and in line with the general standards achieved by their peers.\nEntrance interviews and assessments are undertaken to satisfy ourselves and parents that potential pupils can cope with the\npace of learning and benefit from the education we provide. An individual's economic status, gender, ethnicity, race, religion\nor disability do not form any part of our assessment processes.\nThe College is an equal opportunity organisation that is committed to a working environment free from any form of\ndiscrimination, whether on the grounds of colour, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or disability, and we\nmake reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of staff or pupils who are or become disabled.\nCharitable Activities\nThe principa activity of the Charity continues to be the provision of education to pupils ranging from 4 to 18 years of age. It\nalso runs a number of activity sessions during the school holidays which are open to both pupils and non-pupils of the College,\nand the College facilities are available at other times for use by the local community.\nThe College comprises three constituent schools. The Senior School is a boarding and day school for pupils aged 13-18,\nwhilst the Preparatory School (which is a day school) is for pupils aged from 7-13. The Pre-Prep is for 4-7 year-olds.\nThe College provides a very high standard of education and this is validated in review of the academic results, our\nmeasurements of added value and through external inspection. It offers a broad curriculum and educates children with a\nrange of abilities. Our aim is to support children in reaching their potential in all areas of their activity at the College. This\nmay be in academic subjects but can just as easily be reflected in success in art, drama, sport, music or dance. We produce\nwell-rounded individuals who make a positive contribution to society.\nGrant Making\nThe College does not make grants to external bodies.\nSTRATEGIES AND POLICIES SUPPORTING THE CHARITABLE OBJECTS\nPublic Benefit Aims and Intended Impact\nIn order to meet the Charity's objects, the College aims to create an environment to nurture children, to get the best from\nthem and to allow them to develop and fulfil their full potential. We provide them with a first-class education, independent\nof the maintained sector, and a wide range of sporting, artistic and extra-curricular opportunities and our over-arching public\nbenefit aim is that all pupils will have the skills, the confidence and the intention to contribute to the wider community.\nIn the furtherance of these aims the Directors, as the Charity trustees, have complied with the duty in of the Charities\nAct 201 to have due regard to the Charity Commission's published general and relevant sub-sector guidance concerning the\noperation of the Public Benefit requirement under that Act.\nWoodard and its schools provide a significant benefit to the public. The College strives to ensure that measures of public\nbenefit are appropriate, and that significant sections of the public are not excluded from the opportunity to benefit from the\neducation and facilities offered due to the need to pay a fee. In addition to significant provision of bursaries and other forms\nof financial support, the College provides a wide range of opportunities for community benefit and facilities and events are\n4\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\noften open to all. Further detail of the public benefit offered is included in the section entitled 'Review of Achievements and\nPerformance for the Year' below.\nIt is a key requirement of evidencing public benefit that any private benefit to individuals or elements of the charity will be\nincidenta to the charity's objectives. An example of private benefit may be the reimbursement of travelling expenses for\ntrustees attending training courses: any private benefit to individuals or elements of Woodard are incidental to delivery of\nthe charitable objectives.\nStrategic Aims\nThe Directors conducted a review of the College's long-term strategic plan during the year. There were no significant\nchanges to the College's long-term strategic aims, which are:\nto be the first choice, co-educational, medium-sized, weekly, flexi-boarding and day school for pupils within an hour's\ndrive who seek a genuinely excellent all round education with a strong academic core;\nto maintain and optimise pupi numbers to ensure the long-term viability of the College, to achieve necessary economies\nof scale and to generate sufficient funds to maintain and improve the physical infrastructure of the College;\nto\ncontinue academic improvement and development, by maintaining and fostering a successful and vibrant academic\nenvironment throughout the College and particularly through the strengthening of the sixth form provision;\nto develop the facilities to an excellent standard; and\nto widen public access to our system of schooling as far as possible within the constraints of our funding as an\nindependent education-provider.\nAccess Policy\nIt is important to us that access to the education we offer is not restricted to those who can afford our fees. A great deal of\nlearning occurs through social interaction, conversation and shared experiences, and we believe our pupils benefit from\nlearning within a diverse community where they are able to develop an understanding of the perspectives of other people\nthat will be vital in their adult lives.\nOur various concessions policies, as detailed below, contribute to a widening of access to the education we offer and the\nfacilities we enjoy. These policies are kept under regular review to ensure that able children can accept offers of places at\nthe College regardless of their parental circumstances and means.\nAwards Policy\nThe College is committed to attracting pupils of the highest calibre through scholarships and other awards; and broadening\naccess by offering means-tested financial support in the form of bursaries to eligible parents (or guardians) to assist with the\npayment of the College fees.\nScholarship awards are given for academic potential; for excellence in the fields of music, art, drama, dance and sport; or on\nthe basis of all-round ability. The awards which are not subject to means testing involve a fixed remission of fees of\nbetween 5% and 25%. Where further assistance is required, scholarship awards can be supplemented by a means-tested\nbursary. Bursaries which are available to all holders of scholarship awards and are made solely on the basis of parenta\nmeans are important in helping to ensure that children from families who would otherwise not be able to afford the fees\ncan access the education we offer.\nBursary awards are available for up to 100% of basic fees and additional sums may be provided to meet the cost of extra-\ncurricular activities, equipment and school trips. In addition, bursaries are also available to relieve hardship where a current\n5\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\npupil's education and future prospects would otherwise be at risk - for example, in the case of redundancy. In assessing\nmeans we use the methodology promulgated by the Independent Schools' Bursars Association, which takes a number of\nfactors into consideration including family income, assets and savings, as well as family circumstances for example, dependant\nrelatives and the number of siblings.\nThe College Endowment Fund has been established in order to build an endowment that will be used to provide bursarial\nsupport to talented pupils in future. It is funded by donations from existing parents and transfers from unrestricted funds.\nFor the time being, however the College does not have a meaningful endowment and in funding our awards we have to be\nmindful that we must ensure a balance between fee-paying parents many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to\nfund their child's education - and those benefiting from the awards.\nThe criteria for Awards and the application process are detailed on the College website and in the College's Scholarship\ninformation booklets which are published annually. The availability of scholarship awards and bursaries is advertised widely\nthroughout the year in the local press and details of the schemes are provided to all parents making enquiries about possible\nentry to the College.\nDetails of bursary and other awards are included in the Strategic Report below and in note 2 to the accounts.\nOther Assistance\nTo underline the value we place on continuity for families, at the beginning of the year we increased the discounts offered to\nparents with more than one child at the College; while as part of our emphasis on attracting and retaining high-calibre staff\nwe continue to offer a discount scheme to members of the teaching staff who choose to educate their children with us.\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nREVIEW OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR\nObjectives for 2014/15\nThis year our primary objectives were to:\nConsolidate pupil numbers and maintain the academic standard of students joining Hurst;\nRestructure the timetable and curriculum provision across the College for September 2015 onwards to allow for the\nrevised GCSE and A level courses and produce a coherent academic journey through the College for every pupil;\nDevelop the use of data for academic purposes in the Prep and Pre Prep and embed and strengthen the culture of\nlearning across the entire College;\nComplete the review of the IT provision at the College, and develop a College-wide strategy for the use of all\ntechnologies in teaching and learning;\nCreate a development office to help build and support the newly formed Hurst Society, in order to focus and consolidate\nthe activities of our alumni and parental groups; and\nComplete the central academic axis at the College by undertaking the final stage of the science block redevelopment\nand constructing a further extension to the classroom block.\nPupil Numbers\nPupil numbers at the College during the year were as follows:\n6\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3 AUGUST 2015\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nSenior School\n738\n(37I boarders)\n730\n(382 boarders)\nPreparatory School\n290\n292\nPre-Preparatory School\n54\n69\nTotal\n1,082\n(37I boarders)\n1,09\n(382 boarders)\nThe number of boys and girls educated was as follows:\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nSenior School\n404\n334\n400\n329\nPreparatory School\n15\n139\n166\n127\nPre-Preparatory School\n3\n23\n39\n30\nTotal\n586\n496\n605\n486\nAchievement of the Year's Objectives\nThe objectives set for 2014/15 were largely met.\nAlthough overall pupil numbers declined slightly, this was principally a result of the decision three years ago to move to\none form entry in the Pre-Prep school and there was a further increase in pupil numbers in the Senior School, which\nwas achieved despite the College setting higher standards for entry at both 13+ and 16+;\nFollowing a detailed review, and in the light of the changes announced by the Government to GCSE and A level courses,\nthe timetable and curriculum provision across the College was revised, to ensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent,\nlinear academic programme;\nThe on-line Grades and Reporting System in use in the Senior School for assessing, reporting and monitoring pupi\nprogress was extended throughout the Prep and Pre-prep schools;\nFollowing a review of the IT provision at the College, the decision was taken to provide all pupils entering year 9 with a\nCollege lap-top and to out-source the IT support function from August 2015;\nWork commenced on two major building projects to complete the central academic axis at the College: the final stage\nof the science block redevelopment, incorporating new science laboratories, a lecture room as wel as extended facilities\nfor design technology; and a further extension to the classroom block, including new teaching rooms for drama.\nAcademic Hurst\nIn terms of public examination results, 2014-15 was a highly successful year, with records broken by all three of our external\nexamination year groups.\nOur A*/B percentage at A level rose for the fourth year in succession SO that 77.5% of our A2 results were A*/B grades and\n66 A* grades were achieved overall. Altogether thirty eight pupils gained 3As or better, and A* and A grades made up 49.5%\nof the overall results. Our BTEC Sport class achieved stunning results once more with 100 % Distinctions Starred. One pupil\n7\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nachieved 4A*s in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics and Physics whilst another managed to\nobtain a top DI grade in the Philosophy and Theology Pre-U course (alongside 2 A* graded A Levels). When all the UCAS\npoints achieved by our U6th pupils were counted up, the average score per candidate was 356.0.\nAll those who held provisional Oxbridge or medical offers secured their places, and, in total, 78 students (82% of all those\nproceeding to university this year) went to Russell Group or ex-1994 Group universities to embark on a variety of courses\nranging from Accounting to Veterinary Nursing.\nAt AS level, the class of 2015 saw 29 students achieving three A grades or better, and the highest percentage of A&B grades\never. On results day the statements of results showed 37.6% A grades, with three pupils each having 5 A grades. Seventeen\nstudents gained at least 4 A grades and sixteen had nothing other than A grades on their results statements.\nAt GCSE level, 2015 also brought our highest ever A*/A percentage (66.5%) alongside a record A*/B percentage of 90.6,\nOverall, our fifth form students achieved 423 A* grades, making up 30.9% of our total GCSE grades. Sixty eight pupils gained\n8 or more A* & A grades, while twenty six pupils had only A* and A grades on their statements of results and fourteen had\nI or more A* & A grades. Our iGCSE results were again very strong with 66.2% of all the grades in biology, chemistry and\nphysics being A* grades and 92.5% being A* & A grades. Individually, one student gained IIA*s and IA grade whilst three\nothers achieved A* grades, and another thirty three students collected 10 A* & A grades or better. Three students also\nachieved the top grade of A^ in Further Mathematics.\nAlongside the existing iPad project, and in response to pupil demand for a more functional resource, we are now\nintroducing a laptop programme to pupils in year 9 of the Senior School. This will provide centrally managed, backed-up\nand monitored devices for pupils and staff to support classroom learning. This will mean every pupil in the Senior School\nwith the exception of Year 13 many of whom already have their own devices -will be digitally enabled. In the Prep\nSchool, digital tasks continue to be embedded into all areas of the curriculum and, with a number of class sets of iPads in\ncirculation, teachers from Reception through to Year 6 are able to easily incorporate digital learning opportunities into all\nsubjects of the curriculum. As technology becomes a natural and necessary part of every child's education, so a shift is\noccurring, moving us away from stipulating specific programmes and methods to make use of these digital devices, to\nproviding them and allowing pupils and teachers to utilize them as they see fit to enhance the learning.\nPupil Welfare\nThe College is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of its pupils and expects all staff and volunteers to share\nthis commitment. In the last Independent Schools Inspectorate report, it was recognised that this commitment was given the\nhighest priority, and the quality of the pastoral care at the College was described as excellent. The College has appointed a\nDirector of Safeguarding whose remit is to train all staff and ensure that safeguarding practices and procedures are\nimplemented consistently across the College, and with effect from September 2015 there will be a Deputy Head responsible\nfor all pastoral care in the College.\nParents are given regular information about their children's social and academic progress through parent evenings, through\nthe College's innovative challenge grades which are reviewed and reported approximately every four weeks, and through an\nannual report. We also maintain regular contact with parents throughout the year through informal contacts, regular social\nevents organised in houses and for year groups, and regular newsletters. Parents are also invited to attend talks on pastoral\nissues such as on-line safety and mental health.\nAll pupils have a House Parent who is responsible for their pastoral care and a Tutor responsible for their academic\ndevelopment. We also have a system of student guardians who are involved in assisting staff in enforcing our pro-active anti-\nbullying policy, while pupils also have confidential access to professional Counsellors who visit the school weekly. In addition,\nmedical help is on hand at the College's Medical Centre.\nThe College runs a Student Council so that concerns of the pupil body can be raised and voiced, and these are taken to the\nHouse Parents' meeting which is attended by members of the Senior Management Team. In addition, the College Prefects\n8\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nhave a weekly meeting where welfare concerns are also raised.\nCreative Hurst\nThe main focus for the dance department this year was to present performances in a variety of venues and with different\nstarting points to avoid predictability. The annual Dance Showcase was 'Retrograde', which celebrated 10 years of dance at\nHurst, involving dances performed over the past 10 years by all three schools, along with new material and as an added\ndimension and, for the first time, a couple of former pupils returned to perform the dances they had originally done when\nat the College. The dance department also collaborated on the College musical, 'Sweeny Todd'. The number of boys\nparticipating in extra-curricular dance and opting for GCSE dance is increasing and there are now a number of different\ndance companies, all of whom have residential workshops or perform outside of the College. Dance in the Prep and Pre-\nprep schools continues to develop, with a number of pupils taking ballet exams and several after-school dance activities,\nincluding the popular boys' street dance.\nThe Music Department was busy as always. It contributed again to the Hurst Festival, providing a concert in the village and\nan afternoon's entertainment with tea and cake in the College itself. The house music competition involved everybody in\nthe Senior School singing with their respective houses, while the size of the choir has increased again and is 140-strong.\nThe choir sang at every chape service and excelled particularly in the candle-lit advent procession, the festival of 9 lessons\nand carols, and the leavers' service. The Chamber choir sang carols to the elderly at a variety of locations in and around\nthe village and was once again the choir in residence at the Walsingham National Pilgrimage.\nA choral day for visiting Prep schools led by the director of music was popular and the final concert was a great success, as\nwas the concert given by the choral society of parents and friends concert which was accompanied by a professional\norchestra. The jazz and rock concert and 'Hurst unplugged' were well attended, successful events, giving both bands and\nsolo acts a great performance opportunity, while the Jazz band gave successful concerts to the U3A and at the United\nReformed Church in Burgess Hill. With the retirement of Derick Austin, this year's 'Hurst 'Brie' was devoted to bands\nand past pupils that had been taught by him. As always, this concert was very successful and a great way to round off the\nacademic year.\nIndividually our pupils achieved success in the annual Mid-Sussex music festival and in our own solo music competition.\nNow established as an annual event, the upper sixth formers performed concerto movements accompanied by a\nprofessional orchestra. There are now record numbers of pupils at the College who have achieved grade 8, and a number\ncurrently play in the Brighton Youth and the South Downs' Youth Orchestras.\nPrep school music remained very strong with a full calendar of events throughout the year. Highlights included the winter\nconcert showcasing the various orchestras and ensembles, the Jazz concert in the Lent term, the outdoor summer concert\nand, particularly a successful choir tour to Amsterdam.\nFinally, we were delighted to welcome back an old boy, Richard Hadfield, as a member of the 2014 Britain's Got Talent\nwinners, Collabro who used the Bury Theatre as a venue for their dress rehearsal prior to a national tour. Tickets for the\nconcert were sold out within half an hour and the proceeds will be used for supporting future overseas tours by the music,\ndrama and sport departments.\nThis Art and Photography Department started this year with an exhibition of old books transformed into artwork which\nshowed a stunning level of skill and commitment by students. This set the standard for the rest of the year and the three\ntermly art shows were the best yet. Pupils visited a number of galleries, including Kew, Jerwood, the Royal Academy, the\nNational Gallery and the Tate, while the AS visited the Biennale art show in Venice. The year culminated with a brilliant set\nof exam results for all years, including A*-B grades in GCSE art, 79% A-B in AS art and photography, and 75% A*-B grades at\nA2 in art and photography.\nIn drama, there was a huge range of diverse theatre trips, workshops and showcase performances. The College staged over\n20 productions during the year, 110 students being involved in productions in the Michaelmas term alone. We again\n9\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nparticipated in the local arts festival, the Hurst Festival, and this year 10 fifth form drama scholars performed 'Grandfathers'\nby Rory Mullarkey. The College has been performing Shakespeare plays annually at the College since 1854 and this year's\noffering was 'Twelfth Night', which had a cast predominately comprising Shell drama scholars and was directed by the\nCollege's Playwright in Residence. In addition, an Upper Sixth former, Horatio Gould, wrote and directed his second play,\n'Rex', and Hurst in Rep incorporated a series of six plays directed by the two gap students and four Sixth formers, one of\nwhom also wrote one of the plays. The major showpiece event of the year was the College musical, 'Sweeny Todd'. Owing\nto the unprecedented demand for roles, the decision was taken to cast only year 10 students and above, but even so the cast\nstill numbered over 60. This was an excellent show with strong leads and a hired-in set.\nAlso in the Lent term the annual house film competition took place, with each house producing their own films, written and\ndirected by members of the house and supported by a professional production company, followed by a pre-screening in a\nlocal cinema. During the summer term sixth form students appeared in a stunning version of Steven Berkoffs 'Kvetch', in\nMartin Crimp's' 'Attempts On Her Life' and Odon von Horath's 'Don Juan Comes back From The War'. There were also\ntwo major productions exclusively for Year 9 students, including the annual Shell Shakespeare Festival and the musical 'Fame',\nwhich gave a large number of junior pupils the opportunity to take lead roles and to be trained in the levels of discipline\nnecessary for the main school musical when they are older. In addition, the lower sixth form drama scholars this year\nshowcased the work of a female playwright, Caryl Churchill, while the upper sixth form leavers rounded off the year with a\nperformance of Disney's 'Aladdin'.\nIn the Prep school, the year 7/8 production in the Michaelmas term was Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' which had a huge\ncast. The year 5/6 production also involved over 80 pupils and was a musical version of Oliver, called 'Olivia' while the year\n3/4 production at the end of the summer term was 'The Selfish Giant'. Both these performances were held in the new Moore\nHall, were superbly acted and hugely enjoyable. In addition to these main productions there was the annual Nativity play for\nyears 3/4, a 'play in a day', the LAMDA showcase, the Scholars' performance (the Basil the Rat episode from Fawlty Towers)\nand a drama activity performance, while on an individual level over 80 children took LAMDA exams with well over half\nachieving distinctions.\nSporting Hurst\n2014/15 was probably one of the most rewarding and successful years for sport at the College in recent times and this was\nreflected in the results of the various sporting teams both at the elite and participation levels. In line with this success, the\nCollege continues to develop its sporting programme and profile and the recent opening of a new gym will assist this further.\nIn line with the increased number of pupils at the College, we are running more sports and more teams than ever, and our\nmajor sports of rugby, hockey, netball, cricket and athletics continue to flourish.\nRugby dominates the Michaelmas term programme for boys and we are still developing our fixture list which now sees us\nplaying stronger schools across the South East and whilst the take-up for the sport is good the College must continue to\nencourage boys to participate in order to match the ever more competitive nature of the list. The College's UI3s, UI4s and\nUI6s were all crowned county champions this year and the Ist XV reached the last 32 in the NatWest Vase national\ncompetition, whilst on an individual level Hurst continues to supple a steady stream of players to the county age group sides\nand also to the Harlequins academy. The College is also an official RFU Coach Education Centre, holding a variety of courses\nfor coaches and referees, and we regularly host County teams. Seven-a side rugby is also growing in stature, and we entered\nteams in 6 tournaments last year.\nThe Schools hockey has gone from strength to strength over the last few years, particularly since the opening of our second\nAstro pitch. The boys lst XI came third in the National Hockey Competition at the Lee Valley stadium, which was a fantastic\nachievement for this group, many of whom had come all the way through our Prep school, and from Boys UI4D up to lst\nXI the College won 79% of all games played. We are now consistently competing at the top level both indoors and outdoors\nand we had 9 boys attending the Junior Regional Performance Centre, 4 on the AASE programme and 3 playing for England\nUI7s. Of the girls, 10 attended at JRPC this year, 2 were on the AASE programme and I played for England UI7s. With\n10\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nmore clubs and academies now training at the school after hours, the pupils at all levels get a chance to be part of a club or\ndevelopment academy to further their hockey skills. The College also hosts training and home games for Sussex hockey and\nis now seen as a hub for hockey in the county, and with a number of coaches employed full time, a player welfare team and\nan sports and conditioning coach we are looking to give the pupils every opportunity to improve and perform at all levels.\nNetball also had an outstanding year, which cements Hurst's reputation as the school to beat both within the county and\nbeyond and we have a number of players in the Sussex Netball Academies. Our UI5s were SISNA winners and runners up\nin the Sussex Knock-Out Cup. The Ist VII were runners up at both SISNA and the Sussex Knock Out Cup, while the 16As\nhad a fantastic season, qualifying for the regional round of National Schools and winning both SISNA and the Sussex Knock\nOut Cup. The UI3s also became county champions.\nCricket at the College has never been stronger and the College did not lose a block fixture against another school last\nsummer. The lst XI were national champions at T20 as well as winning the Langdale Trophy as Sussex Under 18 T20 Cup\nwinners and the Woodard Schools Trophy. The College continues to have strong links with Sussex CCC and this year will\nhave three players in the Sussex Academy. Three boys gained national caps, for England UI9, England UI7 and the Dutch\nNational side, while a fourth was named in the team of the tournament for a recent ICC T20 Word Cup qualifying tournament.\nThe minor sports programme is also expanding, with football and triathlon attracting more pupils, and regular competitive\nfixtures. Girls' cricket now has three teams, with the UI5A team winning the Sussex Softball Competition, while girls' tennis\nnow comprises eight squads. Boys and girls athletics has always been strong at Hurst and we continue to be a major player\nin Sussex with a substantial meda haul and county representation. Add to this squash, aerobics, polo, gymnastics, sailing, golf,\nrounders and swimming, and it is evident that the College has a strong and diverse sports programme.\nSport in the Prep School also continued to flourish at all levels.\nIn boys' sport, the senior football teams were particularly successful and the rugby results were also good with several boys\nalso playing club rugby and one player involved with Harlequins academy. The UI3 boys won the rugby County Cup final,\nbut the strength and depth of our teams is something we continue to pride ourselves on, and the football season saw every\nboy in the school play for a team with some fine results against tough opposition. The hockey teams also performed well in\nseveral tournaments and the UI3 boys were crowned County Champions, while cricket remains a strength with a number\nof boys playing club and representative cricket in the County.\nGirls' hockey has been going from strength to strength, having benefitted particularly from a number of our specialist hockey\ncoaches working with the children, and the UI3s were County Champions in the I-a-side game. Netball in the school also\ncontinued to develop well, and during the year we hosted our fourth ""Hocnet' tournament including competitive hockey and\nnetball skills alongside short matches, which was very well received. The UI netball team qualified for the national IAPS\nfinal, a first for Hurst, and although the UI3 team just missed out on qualifying they ended the season by winning the Sussex\nKnockout Cup. Rounders remains popular in the summer, but we also had numerous cricket fixtures with many girls\nparticipating, and this is a growing sport for girls across the college.\nMinor sports such as tennis, athletics, swimming and cross country were all well represented with swimming proving\nparticularly popular. Over 80 pupils also took part in the Athletics after-school club and a number represented Sussex at the\nIAPS Nationals, while the school Triathlon has become a well-established event with many children volunteering to take part\nin one of the three events in the year. In addition, the Prep school again hosted a schools' show-jumping event at Hickstead\nand entered several teams with great success, while orienteering is again on the school calendar with many children enjoying\nthe challenges of this activity, both on and off campus.\nActivity Hurst\nOutdoor Education forms a significant part of the timetable across the whole School, with activities enriching the wider\nexperiences of pupils in all years.\n11\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nOutdoor pursuits are a regular part of the games programme and an established part of our provision for all year groups,\nwith opportunities to participate in sailing, kayaking, climbing and mountain biking This year wakeboard, wind sailing and\nsurfing trips were also offered and we held our first wakeboard competition against another school. The increase in numbers\nhas led to greater competitive success, with Hurst again winning the Independent 2014/15 Schools Ski Championships,\nincluding three individual Gold medals. The College team also came second in the 2014 Independent School Climbing\nChampionships, with a Hurst pupil winning individual Gold.\nThis year some 340 pupils were enrolled on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. There were 64 Gold enrolments, and 38\nstudents successfully completed the Gold award with another 16 expected to complete the expedition by the end of the\nyear. The success rate at silver was also impressive, with over three quarters of participants gaining the award by the end of\nthe lower sixth. In addition, the College continued to offer training sessions to the county and to local schools in the web-\nbased pupil registration and recording system for DoE award participants.\nThe weekly Duke of Edinburgh service afternoon and especially the Combined Cadet Force continues to increase in\npopularity, allowing pupils to broaden their horizons through volunteering, leadership and self-reliance. In addition, the BTEC\nlevel 2 in Public Services has been a particular success, with 18 students gaining a distinction or merit. During the year there\nwere a number of other community schemes including recycling, woodland conservation, farming, community service and\nthe College's in house Creche and these projects are now both well-established and worthwhile, with nearly 200 students\ninvolved. The year also saw students in the UVI return to their community project on a wholly voluntary basis outside their\nCollege commitment.\nThe year 9 and 10 activity programme, which includes self-defence, farming skills, kayaking, fencing and shooting, adds a further\ndimension to the rich and rounded education received by all pupils at Hurst, and the annual Shell multi-activity day and the\nLower Sixth leadership induction day contribute greatly to the development of pupils' team building skills and their\nunderstanding of leadership and management.\nThe Prep School activity programme also continued to offer a wide range of options. Children in Year 8 took part in the\nannual Leavers' Challenge which involved walking part of the South Downs Way in small groups and participating in an\nadventure activity day on route. There was also a ski trip for children in Years 5-8, French trips for pupils in years 5 and 6,\nan activity trip to Snowdonia for Year 8 pupils and an outdoor activity day for the Year 5 students. There is also a weekly\nactivity programme including kayaking, climbing and orienteering for those children who prefer not to play rugby.\nBursaries and Scholarships\nThe College aims to provide opportunities for a wide range of people, particularly those in need, to access benefits from the\nCharity and the College Endowment Fund was established in 2003 in order to accumulate funds which will be used to provide\nfinancial support to talented pupils whose family circumstances would otherwise prevent them from attending the College.\nThe intention is to build up a substantial fund over the years ahead with income earned being utilised to provide means-tested\nbursaries whilst the capital value of the fund is maintained or increased, although this would not preclude the use of capital\nat any time to provide financial support to qualifying pupils. The value of the Endowment Fund is E1.25M.\nWhilst the Endowment Fund is essentially for the future, during the year the College provided scholarships, bursaries and\nother awards exceeding L2.8M to pupils at the College from unrestricted funds. This included means-tested bursaries with\na total value of 4561,000 to 59 children both to supplement scholarship awards and in cases of hardship where the pupil's\neducation and future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Six pupils received assistance (comprising scholarships, external\ngrants and bursaries) for 100% of fees and eight others received assistance for at least 80% of fees.\nScholarships are used to ensure that we are able to maintain high standards in all areas at the College. The total value of\nscholarships awarded in the year was EI.4M. The progress of pupils receiving scholarships is reviewed at least annually to\nensure their progress is in line with their abilities. One scholarship was withdrawn in the year as a result of reviews.\nThe concessions provided by the College represented 12.9% of gross fee income.\n12\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nWider Education\nHurst remains committed to the development of excellence in the classroom, not only within the confines of the College but\nusing its expertise to reach out into the wider profession to support our colleagues in both the maintained and private sectors\nof education.\nThe College continues to value the relationship that it has with its partnership Schools in the Inspire Teaching School Alliance.\nInspire is a group of like-minded schools working in partnership with two local universities to provide teachers with the skills\nand experience to become outstanding practitioners at any stage in their career. The Alliance has a particular focus on\nSchools Direct as a pathway into the teaching profession and in January 2015 Hurst organised and hosted a very successful\ntraining day for all of the School Direct trainees. We were also able to offer a second placement to one of the primary\ntrainees. Several of our staff are members of the various strategic committees within the Alliance.\nOur record for offering training to new and aspiring members of the profession continues to grow. The year saw 8 Newly\nQualified Teachers successfully complete their induction year under the umbrella of the Independent Schools Teacher\nInduction Panel. In February ISTIP inspected our NQT provision and judged the induction policy as excellent, with all NQTs\ndeemed to be focussed, engaged, and feeling very well supported. Alongside the NQTs, the College also committed to fully-\nfunding the Buckingham University PGCE course for two members of staff. The College also employed a number of\nunqualified junior teachers, whose development was supported through one-to-one mentoring, observations and INSET.\nStrong links remain between Hurst and Brighton University, from whom we receive PCGE students for either their first\nor\nsecond placements. Last year we were able to offer 3 placements across Art, Geography and Dance. Alongside our other\ntrainee teachers, all PGCE placement students are offered a programme of targeted INSET to further develop their practice.\nIn June, the Head of Geography hosted a forum for Geography Heads from the '14Group' of schools, providing an opportunity\nto share best practice and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the forthcoming GCSE and 'A' level curriculum\nchanges.\nCommunity Hurst\nThe College is a part of a wider community and we are keen that our staff and pupils participate.\nIn 2015 the College was again actively involved in the local Arts Festival, staging Hurst productions as well as offering facilities,\nvehicles and equipment for festival use; and it also supported numerous local community service activities. In addition, links\nhave been formed with Warden Park, a local maintained school, and we have supported a number of joint ventures with this\nschool.\nBy developing and providing public access to new facilities, the College remains at the heart of the community. Facilities made\navailable to the public include:\nOur sports facilities, which are recognised as being of particular quality and are regularly used by numerous clubs and\norganisations including Brighton & Hove Albion FC (including Sussex Seagulls), Burgess Hill Football Club, Burgess Hill\nTown Ladies FC, Ditchling Cricket Club, Ditchling RFC, England Hockey, First Class Cricket Coaching, Headliners\nCricket, Henfield Cricket Club, Horsham Cricket & Sports Club, Hurst Colts, Hurstpierpoint Cricket Club, Hurst\nHornets FC, Hurstpierpoint Ladies Football Club, Hurstpierpoint Tennis Club, Hurstpierpoint Womens Cricket Club,\nKeymer and Hassocks Cricket Club, Mid Sussex Hockey Club, Mid Sussex Netball Club, Pure Cricket Academy, the\nRugby Football Union, St Andrew's Cricket Club, Sussex Bujin Kan (martial arts training), Sussex County Cricket Club,\nSussex County Hockey, Sussex County Netball Association, Sussex County Rugby, Sussex Martlets cricket, Sussex Netball\nClub, Sussex Nomads cycling club, Sussex RFU, Top Hats and Tutus dance club and Twineham & Wineham Cricket Club.\nThe College minibus fleet, which has been used to support the Brighton Marathon, the Longines Royal International Horse\nShow and also provided ad hoc assistance to Brighton 29th Scout Troop, Lindfield Boys Brigade, Lindfield Primary School,\nLindfield URC youth group, Southwater Scout Troop and Sussex County Netball Club.\n13\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nThe College swimming pool, which is made available to local swimming clubs and organised bodies including Ist Swim\nSchool, Floaters Sports Management, Flippers and Fins, Southdown Lifesavers and Simply Swim.\nOur Chapel, which is open to the public during all services.\nSussex Pages Ltd, a business networking organisation held an event in the dining hall\nThe College grounds, which were made available to Woodlands Meed School for a sponsored walk\nThe sports hall and other facilities, which are used by the Sussex Guild, a self-help organisation for professional designers\nand makers of fine contemporary and traditional craftwork, for their major area show.\nIn addition, during school holiday periods, College facilities were made available to Sussex Police for dog team training and\nfor training sessions run by West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.\nWe also run a choral society for parents and members of the local community; and the College and Prep Schoo Jazz Bands,\nChoirs and other groups regularly perform at charity and fund-raising events across the locality; while numerous arts events\nat the College - including plays, concerts and dance performances - are open to the public.\nWider Charitable Activity\nAs well as supporting the local community through community service activities - including conservation, helping in old\npeople's homes and youth residential centres - the College community takes part in a wide range of sponsored events and\nother fundraising activities. During the year, through the efforts of pupils, parents and staff, the College raised over 427,000\nfor various charities.\nIn addition to this a team of Senior School pupils raised funds for the building of a schoo building in a remote village in Malawi.\nThey also raised funds for their own expenses and went to the location to help with its construction. In June all the Senior\nSchool pupils spent a day on various projects in the local area helping charitable and educational causes.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW AND RESULTS FOR 2014/15\nIn financial terms 2014/15 was another very successful year. Net fee income rose by modest 2.0% as a result of a the slight\ndecline in pupil numbers, an increase in fee concessions and fee increases of 3% - once again below the increases imposed by\nmany of our competitors.\nCosts were generally well contained, although these were inflated by a number of factors, primarily increased spending on\nteachers' salaries, IT and transport, and overall resources expended increased by 2.7%, slightly ahead of the 1.8% increase in\nincoming resources. Expenditure on discretionary building projects fell by 53% to L532,000, as financial resources were\nretained for the two major capita projects which started in early 2015.\nAs a consequence of this and aided by a further 4510,000 income from Activities for Generating Funds - primarily income\nfrom lettings - net incoming resources remained extremely positive at L2.42M, only slightly down on the previous year's high.\nAs a result, operating cash-flow was once again extremely positive and sufficient to fund further capital expenditure of 23.09M\nduring the year.\nOur main trading Company, Hurst Facilities Limited, continues to hire out College facilities during vacations and school hours,\nas well as undertaking commercial activity on behalf of the school and externally (although the main educational letting is\nundertaken by the charity itself). The Company contributed the sum of L33,000 to the College's operating surplus in 2014/15.\nThe parents of our pupils often make significant sacrifices to pay the fees. In doing so they help to relieve the state of the\nfinancial burden of educating over 1,000 UK-based children. This saving to the state is estimated to have a value in the last\nyear of L6.3M.\n14\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nThe school is unable to recover the VAT on purchases it makes. During the past year, the College has paid an estimated\nLI.45M in VAT on goods and services.\nDevelopment of the College Estate\nOver the year expenditure on improvements to College facilities totalled a further E3.26M: including EI.3M on the extension\nto the science block; EI.OM on the extension to the classroom block; E186,000 on repairs to the College's original listed\nbuildings (the latest phase of an on-going programme) 4200,000 on facilities to accommodate the Colleges Estates teams;\n4101,000 on a new gymnasium; over E130,000 on improvements to boarding houses and 476,000 on improvements to the\nCollege's historic cricket pavilion.\nInvestment Performance Against Objectives\nThe Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association permit funds to be invested in such manner as the directors see\nfit, provided that such powers of investment are only exercised for the purpose of attaining the objects and in a manner that\nis legally charitable. The governing body's policy is to preserve the capital value of investments and maximise the return on\nall investments.\nThe College's investments are managed by UBS Wealth Management and in the opinion of the advisers the performance has\nbeen satisfactory. The investment performance is measured against targets provided by our investment advisers. Stock\nmarket conditions showed a continued improvement over the course of the year and the investment return on the College's\nfunds, which are now held in the UBS Resolution Income Fund, for the 12 months to 31 August 2015 was 7.81% compared\nwith the benchmark performance target return of 9.14%.\nReserves Policy\nIn common with most independent schools, the Charity's unrestricted reserves are primarily invested in tangible fixed assets,\nwhich are all used for its direct charitable activities. This utilisation of funds is essential to ensure that high quality up-to-date\nfacilities are available for the benefit of pupils and in order to meet the increasing expectations of our parents. The Directors\nconsider that given the strength of the company's balance sheet, the stable cash flow from full student rolls, the ongoing\npopularity of the College, and the available banking facility that can be called upon if need arises, there is no need to build up\na free reserve.\nFUTURE PLANS\nStrategic Objectives\nThe Board's strategic plan was approved in early September 2014 and is reviewed on an annual basis. The key objectives of\nthe current plan are:\nTo maintain pupil numbers at the present level for both financial as well as educational reasons;\nTo raise academic standards and create a successful and vibrant academic environment throughout the College and to\nfoster academic entrepreneurship at every level;\nTo recruit high quality pupils to the College;\nTo strengthen the boarding ethos and maintain the number of boarders at the College by increasing the number and\nstandard of extra-curricular activities and improving the boarding provision;\nTo further develop key facilities across the Campus;\n15\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nTo widen public access to the College and its resources; and\nTo provide appropriate support to the Woodard Corporation in pursuit of its charitable objectives.\nObjectives for 2015/16\nDuring 2015/16, the College intends to:\nComplete the revision of the curriculum across the College to accommodate the revised GCSE and A level courses and\nensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent, linear academic programme;\nIntroduce a programme of curricular and extra-curricular activities to foster the academic development of the most able\npupils in the College;\nReview the boarding provision at the College and develop a strategy for its development;\nReview and restructure the College's marketing activities and branding, including launching an improved website;\nEmbed and extend the provision of mobile technology use in and out of the classroom;\nComplete the development of the central academic axis at the College and plan for the next phase of campus\ndevelopment.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nRisk Management\nThe Directors are responsible for the identification and management of risks.

Under that law, the directors have elected to prepare financial statements in accordance\nwith United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and\nfair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and the group and of the incoming resources and application of\nresources, including the income and expenditure, of the charitable company and the group for that period. In preparing these\nfinancial statements, the directors are required to:\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\nobserve the methods and principles in the Charities SORP;\nmake judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\nstate whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and\nexplained in the financial statements;\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable\ncompany and the group will continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time\nthe financial position of the charitable company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the\nCompanies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and the group and\nhence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nRelevant Audit Information\nThe directors confirm that:\nSO far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the charitable company's auditor is\nunaware; and\nthe directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit\ninformation and to establish that the charitable company's auditor is aware of that information.\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the\ncharitable company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial\nstatements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nApproved by the Council of Governors of Hurstpierpoint College Limited on 28 November 2015 and signed on their behalf:\nA Jarvis\nChairman\n18\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nCompany Registration No. 3779893 (England and Wales)\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\nTO THE MEMBERS OF HURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\nWe have audited the group and charitable parent company financial statements (the 'financial statements') of Hurstpierpoint College\nLimited for the year ended 31 August 2015 which comprise the principal accounting policies, the consolidated statement of financial\nactivities, the charitable company statement of financial activities, the consolidated and charitable company balance sheets and the\nrelated notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom\nAccounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nThis report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies\nAct 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's members those matters we are\nrequired to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and\nits members and trustees as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nRespective responsibilities of trustees and auditor\nAs explained more fully in the statement of Accounting and Reporting Responsibilities (set out on page 18), the trustees' (who are\nalso the directors of Hurstpierpoint College Limited for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the\nfinancial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.\nOur responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International\nStandards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's (APB's) Ethical\nStandards for Auditors.\nScope of the audit of the financial statements\nA description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB's website at www.frc.org.uklauditscopeukprivate.\nOpinion on financial statements\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent charitable company's affairs as at 31 August 2015 and of\nthe group's and the parent charitable company's incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and\nexpenditure of the group and parent charitable company for the year then ended;\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nOpinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion the information given in the Trustees' Annual Report (incorporating the Strategic Annual Report) for the financial\nyear for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in\nour opinion:\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent charitable company, or returns adequate for our audit have\nnot been received from branches not visited by us; or\nthe parent charitable company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records or returns; or\ncertain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n19\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nCompany Registration No. 3779893 (England and Wales)\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\nTO THE MEMBERS OF HURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nYEAR ENDED 3 AUGUST 2015\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nTat Ahamntin Wh lp\nTom Davies\nSenior Statutory Auditor\nfor and on behalf of Grant Thornton UK LLP\nStatutory Auditor, Chartered Accountants\nLondon\n28 November 2015\n20\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES\n(INCORPORATING AN INCOME AND EXPENDITURE STATEMENT)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\nNotes Unrestricted\nRestricted\nEndowed\n2015\n2014\nFunds\nFunds\nE'000\n2'000\n'000\n2'000\n2'000\nINCOMING RESOURCES\nIncome from Charitable Activities\nSchool fees\n2\n18,996\n-\n-\n18,996\n18,629\nOther educational income\n4\n453\n-\n-\n453\n446\nOther ancillary trading income\n4\n713\n-\n-\n713\n715\nIncoming Activities from Generated Funds\nActivities for generating funds:\nTrading income\n4\n403\n-\n-\n403\n424\nInvestment income\n27\n-\n-\n27\n31\nAppeal income and donations\n5\nI\n79\n-\n80\n73\nOther incoming resources\n4\n3\n-\n3\n-\nTOTAL INCOMING RESOURCES\n20,596\n79\n-\n20,675\n20,318\nRESOURCES EXPENDED\nCosts of generating funds\nFundraising trading\n24\n-\n-\n24\n28\nBank interest\n52\n-\n-\n52\n62\n76\n-\n-\n76\n90\nCharitable Activities\nSchools and grant-making\n18,116\n14\n-\n18,130\n17,653\nGovernance costs\n49\n-\n-\n49\n38\nTOTAL RESOURCES EXPENDED\n9\n18,241\n14\n-\n18,255\n17,78/\nNET INCOMING RESOURCES\n2,355\n65\n-\n2,420\n2,537\nBEFORE TRANSFERS\nTransfers between funds\n2I\n(98)\n98\n-\n-\n-\nNET INCOMING RESOURCES\n2,257\n163\n-\n2,420\n2,537\nRealised gains on investment assets\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSURPLUS FOR YEAR\n2,257\n163\n-\n2,420\n2,537\nUnrealised gains on investment assets\n12\n-\n-\nI\nI\n13\nNET MOVEMENT IN FUNDS\n2,257\n163\nI\n2,42|\n2,550\nFund balances at I September 2014\n18,384\n1,372\n137\n19,893\n17,343\nFUND BALANCES AS AT\n20,641\n1,535\n138\n22,314\n19,893\n31 AUGUST 2015\nAll amounts relate to continuing activities.

Basis of Accounting\nThe accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Accounting\nand Reporting by Charities' and with applicable UK accounting standards. They are drawn up on the historical cost\naccounting basis except that investments held as fixed assets are carried at market value. Financial Reporting Standard 102,\nand a revised Statement of Recommended Practice for Charity Accounting will be applicable for the school's financial\nstatements ending 31 August 2016.\nb. Going Concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors of the charitable Company review the financial\ninformation for the charity and the group, and consider whether the charity and group are going concerns for a period of at\nleast 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable\nexpectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.\nC. Group Accounts\nThe financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company, and all its subsidiary companies, charitable\ntrusts and funds with all inter-company balances being eliminated.\nd. Fees and Similar Income\nFees receivable are accounted for in the period in which the service is provided. Fees receivable are stated after deducting\nallowances, scholarships and other remissions granted by the school, but include contributions received from Restricted\nFunds for scholarships, bursaries and other grants. Fees in Advance are those fees received in advance of the following\nyear's education and are shown as a short term liability until taken to income in accordance with this policy.\nAdvance Fees are those fees received in advance of education to be provided in future years under an Advance Fees Contract\nwhich are held as interest bearing liabilities until either taken to income in the term when used, or else refunded.\ne. Trading Activity and Ancillary Trading Activity\nIncome from holiday and sports hall lettings are recognised in the SOFA activities when the services are provided.\nf.\nDonations and Appeals\nDonations, subject to the specific wishes of the donors, are credited to relevant restricted funds or to endowed funds where\nthe amount is required to be held as permanent capital. Donations received for the general purposes of the school are\ncredited to other unrestricted funds, to distinguish them from direct school income.\n25\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\nI.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nOn occasions the school may set up an appeal to raise finance at times when particular projects are being undertaken.\nMonies received are treated in accordance with the terms of the appeal documentation and are recognised as Designated\nFunds and shown under 'Unrestricted Funds' in the SOFA, rather than as Restricted Funds. Appeal documentation explains\nthat monies can be used for general purposes.\ng. Expenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings either on a direct cost basis or apportioned according to time spent. The\nirrecoverable element of VAT is included with the item of expense to which it relates.\nThe cost of refurbishing and converting existing buildings is written-off in the year in which it is incurred except where the\nuseful life has been extended. Bad debts are provided for in accordance with the group bad debt policy.\nh. Governance Costs\nGovernance costs include the costs attributable to Hurstpierpoint College's compliance with constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, including audit, strategic management and governors' meetings and reimbursed expenses. Such costs include\nboth direct and allocated support costs.\ni.\nFinance and Other Costs\nOther costs include amounts accrued in accordance with the terms of Advance Fee Contracts.\nj-\nPension Costs\nThe Company participates in the Teachers' Pension Scheme (England and Wales) ('the TPS'), an unfunded Government\nscheme, for its teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate\nto consistently identify the liabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the Company. As required by Financial Reporting\nStandard ('FRS') 17 'Retirement Benefits', the Company accounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe company offers membership of the Pensions Trust Growth Plan to all the employees other than the full-time academic\nstaff. The Pensions Trust Growth Plan is a multi-employer pension scheme where the scheme assets are pooled for\ninvestment purposes and cannot be attributed to individual employers. Benefits are paid from the total scheme assets. It is\nin most respects a money purchase arrangement, but has some guarantees. As a result it is not possible or appropriate to\nidentify the assets and liabilities of the scheme which are attributable to the company, though, due to the guarantees inherent\nin the scheme, the companies remain potentially liable for a debt on withdrawal from the scheme. In accordance with FRS\n17 therefore, the scheme is accounted for in a fashion which is similar to a defined contribution scheme. More detail is given\nin notes 26 and 27.\nThe company also contributes to other pension schemes for non-teaching staff.\n26\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nI.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nk.\nTangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Individual capital items, or projects, with a value greater than\n410,000 are capitalised. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. They are\ntransferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.\nWhere appropriate, cost includes our own labour costs in relation to construction, and directly attributable overheads.\nWhere tangible fixed assets have been acquired with the aid of specific grants they are included in the balance sheet at cost\nand depreciated over their expected useful economic life. The related grants are credited to a restricted fixed asset fund\n(in the statement of financial activities and carried forward in the balance sheet). The depreciation on such assets is charged\nin the statement of financial activities over the expected useful economic life of the related asset on a basis consistent with\nthe depreciation policy.\nDepreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected\nuseful life, as follows:\nFreehold land is not depreciated\nFreehold buildings:\nwith an expected life over 50 years\nNil\nwith an expected life under 50 years\nVariable according to the building and written off over the expected\nusefu life\nunder construction\nNil\nMajor items of plant\n10 years\nComputer equipment\n25% on cost\nFurniture and fittings\n25% on cost\nPlant and equipment\nbetween 4% and 25% on cost\nMotor vehicles\n25% on cost\nThe company has reviewed its tangible assets, which comprise land, buildings and initial fixtures and fittings. Where the\ndirectors consider that the expected useful life is in excess of 50 years and the carrying value in the financial statements is\nnot more than the estimated recoverable amount, no depreciation is charged and, in accordance with FRSII the directors\nhave and will continue to carry out annual reviews of impairment. The review is based on the directors' assessments of the\nmarket value and the future economic benefit derived from an asset versus its carrying value in the accounts. Impairment\ncharges are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nk. Investments\nInvestments are carried at market value in accordance with the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and The\nStatement of Recommended Practice 'Accounting and Reporting by Charities'.\nRealised gains are the difference between sales proceeds and opening market value where the investment was held at the\nbeginning of the year, or sales proceeds less cost of purchase where the investment was acquired in the year.\nUnrealised gains are the change in value of investments after taking into account any movements in investment holdings such\nas purchases and disposals of investments. The revaluation reserve reflects the accumulated total of unrealised gains.\nUninvested cash is the balance of liquid cash, held as an investment, which has not been invested in securities.\nI.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\n27\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\nInvestments (Continued)\nRealised and unrealised gains are accounted for within the SOFAs on pages 21 and 22.\nI. Stocks\nStocks comprise raw materials, consumable stores and goods held for resale: they are valued at the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value.\nm. Leasing Commitments\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over\ntheir useful lives or the period of the lease whichever is the shorter. The interest element of the obligations is charged to\nthe SOFA over the period of the lease. Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks\nof ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the SOFA on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nn. Fund Accounts\nEndowment funds are subject to specific conditions by donors that the capital must be maintained by the charity.\nRestricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. The purposes and uses of the\nrestricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\nDesignated funds comprise funds which have been set aside at the discretion of the directors for specific purposes. The\npurposes and uses of the designated funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\nO. Taxation\nHurstpierpoint College Limited is a registered charity and as such is exempt from income tax and corporation tax under the\nprovisions of Section 478 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. There is no similar exemption for VAT, which is included\nin\nexpenditure or in the cost of assets as appropriate.\nThe School has subsidiary companies that are subject to taxes including corporation tax and VAT in the same way as any\ncommercial organisation. The tax charged to the profit and loss accounts is based on the subsidiary companies' profits for\nthe year and takes into account tax arising because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and\naccounting purposes. The subsidiary companies pay over the majority of their profits to Hurstpierpoint College Limited\nunder Gift Aid and tax liabilities are kept to a minimum.\nP. Cash flow statement\nThe cash flows of Hurstpierpoint College Limited are included in the consolidated cash flow statement of The Woodard\nCorporation.

PENSION SCHEMES\nTeachers' Pension Scheme\nThe School participates in the Teachers' Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (""the TPS"") for its teaching staff. This is\na multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate to consistently identify the\nliabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the School. As required by FRSI7 ""Retirement Benefits"", the School\naccounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe pension charge for the year includes contributions payable to the TPS of L770,932 (2014: L7II,I5I) and at the\nyear-end L63,448 (2014 - L57,14I) was accrued in respect of contributions to this scheme.\nThe TPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme governed by the Teachers' Pension Scheme\nRegulations 2014. Membership is automatic for teachers, although they are able to opt out. Members contribute on a\n""pay as you go"" basis with contributions from members and the employer being credited to the Exchequer. Retirement\nand other pension benefits are paid by public funds provided by Parliament.\nThe employer contribution rate is set following scheme valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary Department\nThe latest valuation report in respect of the TPS was prepared at 31 March 2012 and was published in June 2014. This\nreport confirmed that the employer contribution rate for the TPS will increase from 14.1% to 16.4% although,\nrecognising that teaching establishments work on an academic and not financial year, the Government has deferred the\nimplementation of this increase to I September 2015. Employers will in addition from I September 2015 pay a scheme\nadministration levy of 0.08% of the employers' salary costs which will increase the total employer payment rate from\n16.4% to 16.48%.\nThe next revision to the employer contribution rate is not expected to take effect until I April 2019. This will follow\non from the next actuarial valuation which is due at 31 March 2016. This valuation will also determine the opening\nbalance of the cost cap fund and provide an analysis of the cost cap as required by the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.\nA copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation is on the Teachers' Pensions website.\nPensions Trust's Growth Plan\nThe company participates in The Pensions Trust's Growth Plan (the Plan). The Plan is funded and is not contracted-\nout of the State scheme. The Plan is a multi-employer pension plan. Contributions paid into the Plan up to and including\nSeptember 200| were converted to defined amounts of pension payable from Normal Retirement Date. From October\n200 contributions were invested in personal funds which have a capita guarantee and which are converted to pension\non retirement, either within the Plan or by the purchase of an annuity.\n40\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nThe rules of the Plan allow for the declaration of bonuses and/or investment credits if this is within the financial capacity\nof the Plan assessed on a prudent basis. Bonuses/investment credits are not guaranteed and are declared at the\ndiscretion of the Plan's Trustee.\nThe Trustee commissions an actuarial valuation of the Plan every three years. The purpose of the actuarial valuation is\nto determine the funding position of the Plan by comparing the assets with the past service liabilities as at the valuation\ndate. Asset values are calculated by reference to market levels. Accrued past service liabilities are valued by discounting\nexpected future benefit payments using a discount rate calculated by reference to the expected future investment\nreturns.\nThe rules of the Plan give the Trustee the power to require employers to pay additional contributions in order to\nensure that the statutory funding objective under the Pensions Act 2004 is met. The statutory funding objective is that\na pension scheme should have sufficient assets to meet its past service liabilities, known as Technical Provisions.\nIf the actuarial valuation reveals a deficit, the Trustee will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit over a specified\nperiod of time either by way of additional contributions from employers, investment returns or a combination of these.\nThe rules of the Plan state that the proportion of obligatory contributions to be borne by the member and the member's\nemployer shall be determined by agreement between them. Such agreement shall require the employer to pay part of\nsuch contributions and may provide that the employer shall pay the whole of them. The Company paid contributions\nat rates of either 6% or 10%, and members paid contributions at rates of either 3% or 5% during the accounting period.\nAs at the balance sheet date there were 125 active members of the Plan employed by the Company. The Company\ncontinues to offer membership of the Plan to its employees.\nIt is not possible in the normal course of events to identify on a reasonable and consistent basis the share of underlying\nassets and liabilities belonging to individual participating employers. The Plan is a multi-employer scheme, where the\nassets are co-mingled for investment purposes, and benefits are paid out of the Plan's total assets. Accordingly, due to\nthe nature of the Plan, the accounting charge for the period under FRSI represents the employer contribution payable.\nThe valuation results at 30 September 201 were completed in 2012 and have been formalised. The valuation of the\nPlan was performed by a professionally qualified Actuary using the Projected Unit Method. The market value of the\nPlan's assets at the valuation date was 4780 million and the Plan's Technical Provisions (i.e. past service liabilities) were\nf928 million. The valuation therefore revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of liabilities of f148 million,\nequivalent to a funding level of 84%.\nThe financial assumptions underlying the valuation as at 30 September 201 were as follows:\n% per annum\nRate of return pre-retirement\n4.9\nRate of return post retirement:\nActive/Deferred\n4.2\nPensioners\n4.2\nBonuses on accrued benefits\n0.0\nInflation: Retail Price Index (RPI)\n2.9\nInflation: Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n2.4\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\n41\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 3I AUGUST 2015\nIn determining the investment return assumptions the Trustee considered advice from the Scheme Actuary relating to\nthe probability of achieving particular levels of investment return. The Trustee has incorporated an element of prudence\ninto the pre and post retirement investment return assumptions; such that there is a 60% expectation that the return\nwill be in excess of that assumed and a 40% chance that the return will be lower than that assumed over the next 10\nyears.\nThe Scheme Actuary is currently finalising the 2014 valuation and results will be communicated in due course. At 30\nSeptember 2013, the market value of the Plan's assets was 1772 million and the Plan's Technical Provisions (i.e. past\nservice liabilities) was 4927 million. The update, therefore, revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of\nliabilities of E155 million, equivalent to a funding level of 83%.\nIf an actuarial valuation reveals a shortfall of assets compared to liabilities, the Trustee must prepare a recovery plan\nsetting out the steps to be taken to make up the shortfall.\nThe Pensions Regulator has the power under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 to issue scheme funding directions where\nit believes that the actuarial valuation assumptions and/or recovery plan are inappropriate. For example, the Regulator\ncould require that the Trustee strengthens the actuarial assumptions (which would increase the Plan liabilities and hence\nimpact on the recovery plan) or impose a schedule of contributions on the Plan (which would effectively amend the\nterms of the recovery plan). A copy of the recovery plan in respect of the September 201 valuation was forwarded\nto The Pensions Regulator on 2 October 2012, as is required by legislation.\nFollowing a change in legislation in September 2005 there is a potential debt on the employer that could be levied by\nthe Trustee of the Plan, and The Pensions Act 2011 has more recently altered the definition of Series 3 of the Growth\nPlan so that a liability arises to employers from membership of any Series except Series 4. The debt is due in the event\nof the employer ceasing to participate in the Plan or the Plan winding up. The debt for the Plan as a whole is calculated\nby comparing the liabilities for the Plan (calculated on a buy-out basis i.e. the cost of securing benefits by purchasing\nannuity policies from an insurer, plus an allowance for expenses) with the assets of the Plan. If the liabilities exceed\nassets there is a buy-out debt.\nThe leaving employer's share of the buy-out debt is the proportion of the Plan's liability attributable to employment\nwith the leaving employer compared to the total amount of the Plan's liabilities (relating to employment with all the\ncurrently participating employers). The leaving employer's debt therefore includes a share of any 'orphan' liabilities in\nrespect of previously participating employers. The amount of the debt therefore depends on many factors including\ntotal Plan liabilities, Plan investment performance, the liabilities in respect of current and former employees of the\nemployer, financial conditions at the time of the cessation event and the insurance buy-out market. The amounts of\ndebt can therefore be volatile over time.\nThe Growth Plan is a ""last man standing"" multi-employer scheme. This means that if a withdrawing employer is unable\nto pay its debt on withdrawal the liability is shared amongst the remaining employers. The participating employers are\ntherefore, jointly and severally liable for the deficit in the Growth Plan. As at 30 September 2013 the total deficit\ncalculated on the buy-out basis was 2219.9 million. See note 27 for further details.\n42\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n27. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn common with other charities with employees contributing to the Pensions Trust Growth Plan, the Company has\nbeen informed of potentia amounts payable should the Company undertake certain actions, for example significant re-\norganisation, leading to cessation of membership and contributions.\nWhen an employer withdraws from a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme which is in deficit, the employer\nis required by law to pay its share of the deficit, calculated on a statutory basis (known as the buy-out basis), as outlined\nin Note 26. Due to a change in the definition of money purchase contained in the Pensions Act 201 the calculation\nbasis that applies to the Growth Plan will be amended to include Series 3 liabilities in the calculation of an employer's\ndebt on withdrawal.\nThe Pensions Act 201 also proposed regulations which will make ""consequential or transitiona provisions to avoid\nadverse consequences"" Should an employer withdraw prior to the regulations coming into force (expected to be at\nthe end of July 2014), they should contact The Pensions Trust to check whether the regulations could affect their debt\non withdrawal calculation.\nThe Company has been notified by The Pensions Trust of the estimated employer debt on withdrawal from the Plan\nbased on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 September 2014. As of this date the estimated employer debt for\nthe Company was 4607,256, including Series 3 liabilities. These potential liabilities will diminish over time and the\nCompany has no intention to undertake an action which will crystallise the contingent amount.\n28.

It was incorporated as a limited liability Company and wholly\nowned subsidiary of The Woodard Corporation (charity number 1096270) in 1999.\nWoodard schools strive for the best all round education of every aspect of each individual; they ensure high standards of\nreligious education; and they see themselves as communities working together for the benefit of all members, and of the\nChurch and the nation. They are strong Christian foundations which adhere to catholic belief as found in the Church, to\nChristian Worship focused in the Eucharist, and to the care of each individual and the whole school community particularised\nin the ministry of the Chaplain.\nSTRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT\nGoverning Document\nThe Company is governed by its Articles of Association, adopted by Special Resolution on 20 March 2013 and replacing those\ndated 6 July 2005 amended by Special Resolution on 25 January 2006. The Articles permit funds to be managed in such a\nmanner as the directors see fit, provided that such powers are only exercised for the purposes of attaining the objects and\nin a manner which is legally charitable. They forbid the distribution of any property and funds, which are to be applied solely\ntowards the promotion of the objects of the Company.\nGoverning Body\nThe Directors of the Company, who are also the trustees of the Charity, together comprise the governing body of\nHurstpierpoint College. Directors are elected to hold office for five years and are eligible to stand for re-election. The\nDirectors who held office during the year are listed on page 1. None has any beneficial interest in the Company.\nAll Directors are Corporate Fellows (members) of the Woodard Corporation, and are committed to its charitable objects.\nCorporate Fellows are responsible for electing the Woodard Corporation Board.\nRecruitment and Training of Governors\nGovernors are recruited from a wide range of College contacts and from others in the local community. The governing body\nlooks to ensure a mix of skills, and select new governors on the basis of background, competence, specialist skills and, in the\ncase of Fellows, Christian commitment. Governors are provided with induction training by the Head, Bursar and staff, and a\nwider programme of training events is organised by the Woodard Corporation. The College also arranges training sessions\nand encourages governors to attend seminars run by the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools (AGBIS).\nOrganisational Management\nThe Directors meet as a Council four times each year to determine general policy of the Company and review its overall\nmanagement and control, for which they are legally responsible. The work of implementing the majority of the Council’s\npolicies is delegated to a number of committees, membership of which is outlined on page 1.\nThe Finance Committee has a remit to consider budgets, both revenue and capital, cash flow information and financial\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n3\nreports, including the financial statements. It also considers financial policies and the financial regulations. It makes\nrecommendations to the Council for approval. The Finance Committee met three times during the year.\nThe Education Committee is responsible for oversight of the academic performance of the College and for\neducational policy, making recommendations to the Council. It met three times during the year.\nThe Estate Committee develops the College’s estates strategy, including capital developments and maintenance of\nthe buildings, and it makes recommendations to the Council. It is also responsible for oversight of the College’s Health\nand Safety management. It met three times during the year.\nThe Marketing Committee makes recommendations to the Council regarding the promotion of all aspects of the\nCollege, particularly with regards to the successful recruitment of new pupils. It also met three times during the year.\nThe role of the Governance and Nominations Committee is to ensure the Council adheres to the highest\nstandards of internal governance and to consider and propose changes to the membership of the Council. The\nCommittee met twice during the year.\nThe day to day running of the College is the responsibility of the Head and the Bursar, supported by the Senior Management\nTeam.\nGroup Structure and Relationships\nThe College has three wholly-owned non-charitable subsidiaries, Hurst Facilities Limited, Hurst Transport Limited (formerly\nHurst Tech Ltd) and Hurst International Ltd, the activities and trading of which are described below. Note 28 provides\ndetails of connected charities.\nThe College has developed links with a wide range of organisations to ensure the widest possible access to our facilities and\nschooling. Through membership of HMC and IAPS and through networking with peer groups we ensure that we are able to\nattain the highest standards of quality and performance. We encourage our pupils to develop an awareness of the social\ncontext of the all-round education they re ceive at the school and they are engaged in a number of activities to enhance their\nunderstanding. We have an alumni group, the Old Johnians, who are generous in supporting the work of the College and\nwhose support we greatly appreciate. We also cooperate with many local charities in our ongoing endeavours to widen\npublic access to the schooling we can provide, to optimise the educational use of our cultural and sporting facilities and to\nawaken in our pupils, in the public interest, an awareness of the social context of the all-round education they receive.\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES\nCharitable Objects\nThe Charity’s objects, as set out in the Memorandum of Association, are to promote and extend education in accordance\nwith the doctrines and principles of the Church of England, through the operation of Hurstpierpoint College. Within these\nObjects, the Charity also has to maintain its heritage endowment, the College with its Grade 2 chapel and listed buildings,\nand also has various endowed and restricted funds held for special purposes in connection with the development of the\nCollege’s facilities as well as for scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other educational purposes.\nIn setting objectives and planning activities the Directors have given careful consideration to the Charity Commission’s general\nguidance on charitable purposes and public benefit, and in particular to its supplementary guidance on the advancement of\neducation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is a charitable trust which seeks to benefit the public through the pursuit of its\nstated aims. Fees are set at a level to ensure the financial viability of the College and at a level that is consistent with the aim\nof providing a first class education to all pupils. The College’s charitable objectives are ‘to promote and extend education’,\nand these objectives are recognised as benefiting the public when pursued in the context of formal education in a body where\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n4\nall surplus funds are re-invested. The Woodard Corporation and all of the schools it owns are charitable bodies, with no\nexternal shareholders and no possibility of making distributions, whether in the form of dividends or otherwise. All surpluses\nare re-invested in education.\nThe College welcomes pupils from all backgrounds. To admit a prospective pupil we need to be satisfied that we will be able\nto educate and develop them to the best of their potential and in line with the general standards achieved by their peers.\nEntrance interviews and assessments are undertaken to satisfy ourselves and parents that potential pupils can cope with the\npace of learning and benefit from the education we provide. An individual’s economic status, gender, ethnicity, race, religion\nor disability do not form any part of our assessment processes.\nThe College is an equal opportunity organisation that is committed to a working environment free from any form of\ndiscrimination, whether on the grounds of colour, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or disability, and we\nmake reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of staff or pupils who are or become disabled.\nCharitable Activities\nThe principal activity of the Charity continues to be the provision of education to pupils ranging from 4 to 18 years of age. It\nalso runs a number of activity sessions during the school holidays which are open to both pupils and non-pupils of the College,\nand the College facilities are available at other times for use by the local community.\nThe College comprises three constituent schools. The Senior School is a boarding and day school for pupils aged 13-18,\nwhilst the Preparatory School (which is a day school) is for pupils aged from 7-13 . The Pre-Prep is for 4-7 year-olds.\nThe College provides a very high standard of education and this is validated in review of the academic results, our\nmeasurements of added value and through external inspection. It offers a broad curriculum and educates children with a\nrange of abilities. Our aim is to support children in reaching their potential in all areas of their activity at the College. This\nmay be in academic subjects but can just as easily be reflected in success in art, drama, sport, music or dance. We produce\nwell-rounded individuals who make a positive contribution to society.\nGrant Making\nThe College does not make grants to external bodies.\nSTRATEGIES AND POLICIES SUPPORTING THE CHARITABLE OBJECTS\nPublic Benefit Aims and Intended Impact\nIn order to meet the Charity’s objects, the College aims to create an environment to nurture children, to get the best from\nthem and to allow them to develop and fulfil their full potential. We provide them with a first-class education, independent\nof the maintained sector, and a wide range of sporting, artistic and extra-curricular opportunities, and our over-arching public\nbenefit aim is that all pupils will have the skills, the confidence and the intention to contribute to the wider community.\nIn the furtherance of these aims the Directors, as the Charity trustees, have complied with the duty in s.17 of the Charities\nAct 2011 to have due regard to the Charity Commission’s published general and relevant sub-sector guidance concerning the\noperation of the Public Benefit requirement under that Act.\nWoodard and its schools provide a significant benefit to the public. The College strives to ensure that measures of public\nbenefit are appropriate, and that significant sections of the public are not excluded from the opportunity to benefit from the\neducation and facilities offered due to the need to pay a fee. In addition to significant provision of bursaries and other forms\nof financial support, the College provides a wide range of opportunities for community benefit and facilities and events are\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n5\noften open to all. Further detail of the public benefit offered is included in the section entitled ‘Review of Achievements and\nPerformance for the Year’ below.\nIt is a key requirement of evidencing public benefit that any private benefit to individuals or elements of the charity will be\nincidental to the charity's objectives. An example of private benefit may be the reimbursement of travelling expenses for\ntrustees attending training courses: any private benefit to individuals or elements of Woodard are incidental to delivery of\nthe charitable objectives.\nStrategic Aims\nThe Directors conducted a review of the College’s long-term strategic plan during the year. There were no significant\nchanges to the College’s long-term strategic aims, which are:\n\nto be the first choice, co-educational, medium-sized, weekly, flexi-boarding and day school for pupils within an hour’s\ndrive who seek a genuinely excellent all round education with a strong academic core;\n\nto maintain and optimise pupil numbers to ensure the long-term viability of the College, to achieve necessary economies\nof scale and to generate sufficient funds to maintain and improve the physical infrastructure of the College;\n\nto continue academic improvement and development, by maintaining and fostering a successful and vibrant academic\nenvironment throughout the College and particularly through the strengthening of the sixth form provision;\n\nto develop the facilities to an excellent standard; and\n\nto widen public access to our system of schooling as far as possible within the constraints of our funding as an\nindependent education-provider.\nAccess Policy\nIt is important to us that access to the education we offer is not restricted to those who can afford our fees. A great deal of\nlearning occurs through social interaction, conversation and shared experiences, and we believe our pupils benefit from\nlearning within a diverse community where they are able to develop an understanding of the perspectives of other people\nthat will be vital in their adult lives.\nOur various concessions policies, as detailed below, contribute to a widening of access to the education we offer and the\nfacilities we enjoy. These policies are kept under regular review to ensure that able children can accept offers of places at\nthe College regardless of their parental circumstances and means.\nAwards Policy\nThe College is committed to attracting pupils of the highest calibre through scholarships and other awards; and broadening\naccess by offering means-tested financial support in the form of bursaries to eligible parents (or guardians) to assist with the\npayment of the College fees.\nScholarship awards are given for academic potential; for excellence in the fields of music, art, drama, dance and sport; or on\nthe basis of all-round ability. The awards – which are not subject to means testing – involve a fixed remission of fees of\nbetween 5% and 25%. Where further assistance is required, scholarship awards can be supplemented by a means-tested\nbursary. Bursaries – which are available to all holders of scholarship awards and are made solely on the basis of parental\nmeans – are important in helping to ensure that children from families who would otherwise not be able to afford the fees\ncan access the education we offer.\nBursary awards are available for up to 100% of basic fees and additional sums may be provided to meet the cost of extra-\ncurricular activities, equipment and school trips. In addition, bursaries are also available to relieve hardship where a current\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n6\npupil’s education and future prospects would otherwise be at risk – for example, in the case of redundancy. In assessing\nmeans we use the methodology promulgated by the Independent Schools’ Bursars Association, which takes a number of\nfactors into consideration including family income, assets and savings, as well as family circumstances – for example, dependant\nrelatives and the number of siblings.\nThe College Endowment Fund has been established in order to build an endowment that will be used to provide bursarial\nsupport to talented pupils in future. It is funded by donations from existing parents and transfers from unrestricted funds.\nFor the time being, however, the College does not have a meaningful endowment and in funding our awards we have to be\nmindful that we must ensure a balance between fee-paying parents – many of whom make considerable personal sacrifices to\nfund their child’s education – and those benefiting from the awards.\nThe criteria for Awards and the application process are detailed on the College website and in the College’s Scholarship\ninformation booklets which are published annually. The availability of scholarship awards and bursaries is advertised widely\nthroughout the year in the local press and details of the schemes are provided to all parents making enquiries about possible\nentry to the College.\nDetails of bursary and other awards are included in the Strategic Report below and in note 2 to the accounts.\nOther Assistance\nTo underline the value we place on continuity for families, at the beginning of the year we increased the discounts offered to\nparents with more than one child at the College; while as part of our emphasis on attracting and retaining high-calibre staff\nwe continue to offer a discount scheme to members of the teaching staff who choose to educate their children with us.\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nREVIEW OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR\nObjectives for 2014/15\nThis year our primary objectives were to:\n\nConsolidate pupil numbers and maintain the academic standard of students joining Hurst;\n\nRestructure the timetable and curriculum provision across the College for September 2015 onwards to allow for the\nrevised GCSE and A level courses and produce a coherent academic journey through the College for every pupil;\n\nDevelop the use of data for academic purposes in the Prep and Pre Prep and embed and strengthen the culture of\nlearning across the entire College;\n\nComplete the review of the IT provision at the College, and develop a College-wide strategy for the use of all\ntechnologies in teaching and learning;\n\nCreate a development office to help build and support the newly formed Hurst Society, in order to focus and consolidate\nthe activities of our alumni and parental groups; and\n\nComplete the central academic axis at the College by undertaking the final stage of the science block redevelopment\nand constructing a further extension to the classroom block.\nPupil Numbers\nPupil numbers at the College during the year were as follows:\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n7\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nSenior School\n738\n(371 boarders)\n730\n(382 boarders)\nPreparatory School\n290\n292\nPre-Preparatory School\n54\n69\n_____\n_____\nTotal\n1,082\n(371 boarders)\n1,091\n(382 boarders)\n_____\n_____\nThe number of boys and girls educated was as follows:\n2014/2015\n2013/2014\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nSenior School\n404\n334\n400\n329\nPreparatory School\n151\n139\n166\n127\nPre-Preparatory School\n31\n23\n39\n30\n_____\n_____\n_____\n_____\nTotal\n586\n496\n605\n486\n_____\n_____\n_____\n_____\nAchievement of the Year’s Objectives\nThe objectives set for 2014/15 were largely met.\n\nAlthough overall pupil numbers declined slightly, this was principally a result of the decision three years ago to move to\none form entry in the Pre-Prep school and there was a further increase in pupil numbers in the Senior School, which\nwas achieved despite the College setting higher standards for entry at both 13+ and 16+;\n\nFollowing a detailed review, and in the light of the changes announced by the Government to GCSE and A level courses,\nthe timetable and curriculum provision across the College was revised, to ensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent,\nlinear academic programme;\n\nThe on-line Grades and Reporting System in use in the Senior School for assessing, reporting and monitoring pupil\nprogress was extended throughout the Prep and Pre-prep schools;\n\nFollowing a review of the IT provision at the College, the decision was taken to provide all pupils entering year 9 with a\nCollege lap-top and to out-source the IT support function from August 2015;\n\nWork commenced on two major building projects to complete the central academic axis at the College: the final stage\nof the science block redevelopment, incorporating new science laboratories, a lecture room as well as extended facilities\nfor design technology; and a further extension to the classroom block, including new teaching rooms for drama.\nAcademic Hurst\nIn terms of public examination results, 2014-15 was a highly successful year, with records broken by all three of our external\nexamination year groups.\nOur A*/B percentage at A level rose for the fourth year in succession so that 77.5% of our A2 results were A*/B grades and\n66 A* grades were achieved overall. Altogether thirty eight pupils gained 3As or better, and A* and A grades made up 49.5%\nof the overall results. Our BTEC Sport class achieved stunning results once more with 100 % Distinctions Starred. One pupil\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n8\nachieved 4A*s in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics and Physics whilst another managed to\nobtain a top D1 grade in the Philosophy and Theology Pre–U course (alongside 2 A* graded A Levels). When all the UCAS\npoints achieved by our U6th pupils were counted up, the average score per candidate was 356.0 .\nAll those who held provisional Oxbridge or medical offers secured their places, and, in total, 78 students (82% of all those\nproceeding to university this year) went to Russell Group or ex-1994 Group universities to embark on a variety of courses\nranging from Accounting to Veterinary Nursing.\nAt AS level, the class of 2015 saw 29 students achieving three A grades or better, and the highest percentage of A&B grades\never. On results day the statements of results showed 37.6% A grades, with three pupils each having 5 A grades. Seventeen\nstudents gained at least 4 A grades and sixteen had nothing other than A grades on their results statements.\nAt GCSE level, 2015 also brought our highest ever A*/A percentage (66.5%) alongside a record A*/B percentage of 90.6,\nOverall, our fifth form students achieved 423 A* grades, making up 30.9% of our total GCSE grades. Sixty eight pupils gained\n8 or more A* & A grades, while twenty six pupils had only A* and A grades on their statements of results and fourteen had\n11 or more A* & A grades. Our iGCSE results were again very strong with 66.2% of all the grades in biology, chemistry and\nphysics being A* grades and 92.5% being A* & A grades. Individually, one student gained 11A*s and 1A grade whilst three\nothers achieved 11 A* grades, and another thirty three students collected 10 A* & A grades or better. Three students also\nachieved the top grade of A^ in Further Mathematics.\nAlongside the existing iPad project, and in response to pupil demand for a more functional resource, we are now\nintroducing a laptop programme to pupils in year 9 of the Senior School. This will provide centrally managed, backed-up\nand monitored devices for pupils and staff to support classroom learning. This will mean every pupil in the Senior School\nwith the exception of Year 13 – many of whom already have their own devices –will be digitally enabled. In the Prep\nSchool, digital tasks continue to be embedded into all areas of the curriculum and, with a number of class sets of iPads in\ncirculation, teachers from Reception through to Year 6 are able to easily incorporate digital learning opportunities into all\nsubjects of the curriculum. As technology becomes a natural and necessary part of every child’s education, so a shift is\noccurring, moving us away from stipulating specific programmes and methods to make use of these digital devices, to\nproviding them and allowing pupils and teachers to utilize them as they see fit to enhance the learning.\nPupil Welfare\nThe College is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of its pupils and expects all staff and volunteers to share\nthis commitment. In the last Independent Schools Inspectorate report, it was recognised that this commitment was given the\nhighest priority, and the quality of the pastoral care at the College was described as excellent. The College has appointed a\nDirector of Safeguarding whose remit is to train all staff and ensure that safeguarding practices and procedures are\nimplemented consistently across the College, and with effect from September 2015 there will be a Deputy Head responsible\nfor all pastoral care in the College.\nParents are given regular information about their children’s social and academic progress through parent evenings, through\nthe College’s innovative challenge grades which are reviewed and reported approximately every four weeks, and through an\nannual report. We also maintain regular contact with parents throughout the year through informal contacts, regular social\nevents organised in houses and for year groups, and regular newsletters. Parents are also invited to attend talks on pastoral\nissues such as on-line safety and mental health.\nAll pupils have a House Parent who is responsible for their pastoral care and a Tutor responsible for their academic\ndevelopment. We also have a system of student guardians who are involved in assisting staff in enforcing our pro-active anti-\nbullying policy, while pupils also have confidential access to professional Counsellors who visit the school weekly. In addition,\nmedical help is on hand at the College’s Medical Centre.\nThe College runs a Student Council so that concerns of the pupil body can be raised and voiced, and these are taken to the\nHouse Parents’ meeting which is attended by members of the Senior Management Team. In addition, the College Prefects\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n9\nhave a weekly meeting where welfare concerns are also raised.\nCreative Hurst\nThe main focus for the dance department this year was to present performances in a variety of venues and with different\nstarting points to avoid predictability. The annual Dance Showcase was ‘Retrograde’, which celebrated 10 years of dance at\nHurst, involving dances performed over the past 10 years by all three schools, along with new material and as an added\ndimension and, for the first time, a couple of former pupils returned to perform the dances they had originally done when\nat the College. The dance department also collaborated on the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. The number of boys\nparticipating in extra-curricular dance and opting for GCSE dance is increasing and there are now a number of different\ndance companies, all of whom have residential workshops or perform outside of the College. Dance in the Prep and Pre-\nprep schools continues to develop, with a number of pupils taking ballet exams and several after-school dance activities,\nincluding the popular boys’ street dance.\nThe Music Department was busy as always. It contributed again to the Hurst Festival, providing a concert in the village and\nan afternoon’s entertainment with tea and cake in the College itself. The house music competition involved everybody in\nthe Senior School singing with their respective houses, while the size of the choir has increased again and is now140-strong.\nThe choir sang at every chapel service and excelled particularly in the candle-lit advent procession, the festival of 9 lessons\nand carols, and the leavers’ service. The Chamber choir sang carols to the elderly at a variety of locations in and around\nthe village and was once again the choir in residence at the Walsingham National Pilgrimage.\nA choral day for visiting Prep schools led by the director of music was popular and the final concert was a great success, as\nwas the concert given by the choral society of parents and friends concert which was accompanied by a professional\norchestra. The jazz and rock concert and ‘Hurst unplugged’ were well attended, successful events, giving both bands and\nsolo acts a great performance opportunity, while the Jazz band gave successful concerts to the U3A and at the United\nReformed Church in Burgess Hill. With the retirement of Derick Austin, this year’s ‘Hurst n’Brie’ was devoted to bands\nand past pupils that had been taught by him. As always, this concert was very successful and a great way to round off the\nacademic year.\nIndividually our pupils achieved success in the annual Mid-Sussex music festival and in our own solo music competition.\nNow established as an annual event, the upper sixth formers performed concerto movements accompanied by a\nprofessional orchestra. There are now record numbers of pupils at the College who have achieved grade 8, and a number\ncurrently play in the Brighton Youth and the South Downs’ Youth Orchestras.\nPrep school music remained very strong with a full calendar of events throughout the year. Highlights included the winter\nconcert showcasing the various orchestras and ensembles, the Jazz concert in the Lent term, the outdoor summer concert\nand, particularly, a successful choir tour to Amsterdam.\nFinally, we were delighted to welcome back an old boy, Richard Hadfield, as a member of the 2014 Britain’s Got Talent\nwinners, Collabro who used the Bury Theatre as a venue for their dress rehearsal prior to a national tour. Tickets for the\nconcert were sold out within half an hour and the proceeds will be used for supporting future overseas tours by the music,\ndrama and sport departments.\nThis Art and Photography Department started this year with an exhibition of old books transformed into artwork which\nshowed a stunning level of skill and commitment by students. This set the standard for the rest of the year and the three\ntermly art shows were the best yet. Pupils visited a number of galleries, including Kew, Jerwood, the Royal Academy, the\nNational Gallery and the Tate, while the AS visited the Biennale art show in Venice. The year culminated with a brilliant set\nof exam results for all years, including A*-B grades in GCSE art, 79% A-B in AS art and photography, and 75% A*-B grades at\nA2 in art and photography.\nIn drama, there was a huge range of diverse theatre trips, workshops and showcase performances. The College staged over\n20 productions during the year, 110 students being involved in productions in the Michaelmas term alone. We again\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n10\nparticipated in the local arts festival, the Hurst Festival, and this year 10 fifth form drama scholars performed ‘Grandfathers’\nby Rory Mullarkey. The College has been performing Shakespeare plays annually at the College since 1854 and this year’s\noffering was ‘Twelfth Night’, which had a cast predominately comprising Shell drama scholars and was directed by the\nCollege’s Playwright in Residence. In addition, an Upper Sixth former, Horatio Gould, wrote and directed his second play,\n‘Rex’, and Hurst in Rep incorporated a series of six plays directed by the two gap students and four Sixth formers, one of\nwhom also wrote one of the plays. The major showpiece event of the year was the College musical, ‘Sweeny Todd’. Owing\nto the unprecedented demand for roles, the decision was taken to cast only year 10 students and above, but even so the cast\nstill numbered over 60. This was an excellent show with strong leads and a hired-in set.\nAlso in the Lent term the annual house film competition took place, with each house producing their own films, written and\ndirected by members of the house and supported by a professional production company, followed by a pre-screening in a\nlocal cinema. During the summer term sixth form students appeared in a stunning version of Steven Berkoff’s ‘Kvetch’, in\nMartin Crimp’s’ ‘Attempts On Her Life’ and Odon von Horath’s ‘Don Juan Comes back From The War’. There were also\ntwo major productions exclusively for Year 9 students, including the annual Shell Shakespeare Festival and the musical ‘Fame’,\nwhich gave a large number of junior pupils the opportunity to take lead roles and to be trained in the levels of discipline\nnecessary for the main school musical when they are older. In addition, the lower sixth form drama scholars this year\nshowcased the work of a female playwright, Caryl Churchill, while the upper sixth form leavers rounded off the year with a\nperformance of Disney’s ‘Aladdin’.\nIn the Prep school, the year 7/8 production in the Michaelmas term was Disney’s ‘Beauty and the Beast’ which had a huge\ncast. The year 5/6 production also involved over 80 pupils and was a musical version of Oliver, called ‘Olivia’ while the year\n3/4 production at the end of the summer term was ‘The Selfish Giant’. Both these performances were held in the new Moore\nHall, were superbly acted and hugely enjoyable. In addition to these main productions there was the annual Nativity play for\nyears 3/4, a ‘play in a day’, the LAMDA showcase, the Scholars’ performance (the Basil the Rat episode from Fawlty Towers)\nand a drama activity performance, while on an individual level over 80 children took LAMDA exams with well over half\nachieving distinctions.\nSporting Hurst\n2014/15 was probably one of the most rewarding and successful years for sport at the College in recent times and this was\nreflected in the results of the various sporting teams both at the elite and participation levels. In line with this success, the\nCollege continues to develop its sporting programme and profile and the recent opening of a new gym will assist this further.\nIn line with the increased number of pupils at the College, we are running more sports and more teams than ever, and our\nmajor sports of rugby, hockey, netball, cricket and athletics continue to flourish.\nRugby dominates the Michaelmas term programme for boys and we are still developing our fixture list which now sees us\nplaying stronger schools across the South East and whilst the take-up for the sport is good the College must continue to\nencourage boys to participate in order to match the ever more competitive nature of the list. The College’s U13s, U14s and\nU16s were all crowned county champions this year and the 1st XV reached the last 32 in the NatWest Vase national\ncompetition, whilst on an individual level Hurst continues to supple a steady stream of players to the county age group sides\nand also to the Harlequins academy. The College is also an official RFU Coach Education Centre, holding a variety of courses\nfor coaches and referees, and we regularly host County teams. Seven-a side rugby is also growing in stature, and we entered\nteams in 6 tournaments last year.\nThe Schools hockey has gone from strength to strength over the last few years, particularly since the opening of our second\nAstro pitch. The boys 1st XI came third in the National Hockey Competition at the Lee Valley stadium, which was a fantastic\nachievement for this group, many of whom had come all the way through our Prep school, and from Boys U14D up to 1st\nXI the College won 79% of all games played. We are now consistently competing at the top level both indoors and outdoors\nand we had 9 boys attending the Junior Regional Performance Centre, 4 on the AASE programme and 3 playing for England\nU17s. Of the girls, 10 attended at JRPC this year, 2 were on the AASE programme and 1 played for England U17s. With\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n11\nmore clubs and academies now training at the school after hours, the pupils at all levels get a chance to be part of a club or\ndevelopment academy to further their hockey skills. The College also hosts training and home games for Sussex hockey and\nis now seen as a hub for hockey in the county, and with a number of coaches employed full time, a player welfare team and\nan sports and conditioning coach we are looking to give the pupils every opportunity to improve and perform at all levels.\nNetball also had an outstanding year, which cements Hurst’s reputation as the school to beat both within the county and\nbeyond and we have a number of players in the Sussex Netball Academies. Our U15s were SISNA winners and runners up\nin the Sussex Knock-Out Cup. The 1st VII were runners up at both SISNA and the Sussex Knock Out Cup, while the 16As\nhad a fantastic season, qualifying for the regional round of National Schools and winning both SISNA and the Sussex Knock\nOut Cup. The U13s also became county champions.\nCricket at the College has never been stronger and the College did not lose a block fixture against another school last\nsummer. The 1st XI were national champions at T20 as well as winning the Langdale Trophy as Sussex Under 18 T20 Cup\nwinners and the Woodard Schools Trophy. The College continues to have strong links with Sussex CCC and this year will\nhave three players in the Sussex Academy. Three boys gained national caps, for England U19, England U17 and the Dutch\nNational side, while a fourth was named in the team of the tournament for a recent ICC T20 Word Cup qualifying tournament.\nThe minor sports programme is also expanding, with football and triathlon attracting more pupils, and regular competitive\nfixtures. Girls’ cricket now has three teams, with the U15A team winning the Sussex Softball Competition, while girls’ tennis\nnow comprises eight squads. Boys and girls athletics has always been strong at Hurst and we continue to be a major player\nin Sussex with a substantial medal haul and county representation. Add to this squash, aerobics, polo, gymnastics, sailing, golf,\nrounders and swimming, and it is evident that the College has a strong and diverse sports programme.\nSport in the Prep School also continued to flourish at all levels.\nIn boys' sport, the senior football teams were particularly successful and the rugby results were also good with several boys\nalso playing club rugby and one player involved with Harlequins academy. The U13 boys won the rugby County Cup final,\nbut the strength and depth of our teams is something we continue to pride ourselves on, and the football season saw every\nboy in the school play for a team with some fine results against tough opposition. The hockey teams also performed well in\nseveral tournaments and the U13 boys were crowned County Champions, while cricket remains a strength with a number\nof boys playing club and representative cricket in the County.\nGirls' hockey has been going from strength to strength, having benefitted particularly from a number of our specialist hockey\ncoaches working with the children, and the U13s were County Champions in the 11-a-side game. Netball in the school also\ncontinued to develop well, and during the year we hosted our fourth ‘Hocnet’ tournament including competitive hockey and\nnetball skills alongside short matches, which was very well received. The U11 netball team qualified for the national IAPS\nfinal, a first for Hurst, and although the U13 team just missed out on qualifying they ended the season by winning the Sussex\nKnockout Cup. Rounders remains popular in the summer, but we also had numerous cricket fixtures with many girls\nparticipating, and this is a growing sport for girls across the college.\nMinor sports such as tennis, athletics, swimming and cross country were all well represented with swimming proving\nparticularly popular. Over 80 pupils also took part in the Athletics after-school club and a number represented Sussex at the\nIAPS Nationals, while the school Triathlon has become a well-established event with many children volunteering to take part\nin one of the three events in the year. In addition, the Prep school again hosted a schools’ show-jumping event at Hickstead\nand entered several teams with great success, while orienteering is again on the school calendar with many children enjoying\nthe challenges of this activity, both on and off campus.\nActivity Hurst\nOutdoor Education forms a significant part of the timetable across the whole School, with activities enriching the wider\nexperiences of pupils in all years.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n12\nOutdoor pursuits are a regular part of the games programme and an established part of our provision for all year groups,\nwith opportunities to participate in sailing, kayaking, climbing and mountain biking. This year wakeboard, wind sailing and\nsurfing trips were also offered and we held our first wakeboard competition against another school. The increase in numbers\nhas led to greater competitive success, with Hurst again winning the Independent 2014/15 Schools Ski Championships,\nincluding three individual Gold medals. The College team also came second in the 2014 Independent School Climbing\nChampionships, with a Hurst pupil winning individual Gold.\nThis year some 340 pupils were enrolled on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. There were 64 Gold enrolments, and 38\nstudents successfully completed the Gold award with another 16 expected to complete the expedition by the end of the\nyear. The success rate at silver was also impressive, with over three quarters of participants gaining the award by the end of\nthe lower sixth. In addition, the College continued to offer training sessions to the county and to local schools in the web-\nbased pupil registration and recording system for DoE award participants.\nThe weekly Duke of Edinburgh service afternoon – and especially the Combined Cadet Force – continues to increase in\npopularity, allowing pupils to broaden their horizons through volunteering, leadership and self-reliance. In addition, the BTEC\nlevel 2 in Public Services has been a particular success, with 18 students gaining a distinction or merit. During the year there\nwere a number of other community schemes – including recycling, woodland conservation, farming, community service and\nthe College’s in house Crèche – and these projects are now both well-established and worthwhile, with nearly 200 students\ninvolved. The year also saw students in the UVI return to their community project on a wholly voluntary basis outside their\nCollege commitment.\nThe year 9 and 10 activity programme, which includes self-defence, farming skills, kayaking, fencing and shooting, adds a further\ndimension to the rich and rounded education received by all pupils at Hurst, and the annual Shell multi-activity day and the\nLower Sixth leadership induction day contribute greatly to the development of pupils’ team building skills and their\nunderstanding of leadership and management.\nThe Prep School activity programme also continued to offer a wide range of options. Children in Year 8 took part in the\nannual Leavers’ Challenge which involved walking part of the South Downs Way in small groups and participating in an\nadventure activity day on route. There was also a ski trip for children in Years 5-8, French trips for pupils in years 5 and 6,\nan activity trip to Snowdonia for Year 8 pupils and an outdoor activity day for the Year 5 students. There is also a weekly\nactivity programme including kayaking, climbing and orienteering for those children who prefer not to play rugby.\nBursaries and Scholarships\nThe College aims to provide opportunities for a wide range of people, particularly those in need, to access benefits from the\nCharity and the College Endowment Fund was established in 2003 in order to accumulate funds which will be used to provide\nfinancial support to talented pupils whose family circumstances would otherwise prevent them from attending the College.\nThe intention is to build up a substantial fund over the years ahead with income earned being utilised to provide means-tested\nbursaries whilst the capital value of the fund is maintained or increased, although this would not preclude the use of capital\nat any time to provide financial support to qualifying pupils. The value of the Endowment Fund is £1.25M.\nWhilst the Endowment Fund is essentially for the future, during the year the College provided scholarships, bursaries and\nother awards exceeding £2.8M to pupils at the College from unrestricted funds. This included means-tested bursaries with\na total value of £561,000 to 59 children both to supplement scholarship awards and in cases of hardship where the pupil’s\neducation and future prospects would otherwise be at risk. Six pupils received assistance (comprising scholarships, external\ngrants and bursaries) for 100% of fees and eight others received assistance for at least 80% of fees.\nScholarships are used to ensure that we are able to maintain high standards in all areas at the College. The total value of\nscholarships awarded in the year was £1.4M . The progress of pupils receiving scholarships is reviewed at least annually to\nensure their progress is in line with their abilities. One scholarship was withdrawn in the year as a result of reviews.\nThe concessions provided by the College represented 12.9% of gross fee income.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n13\nWider Education\nHurst remains committed to the development of excellence in the classroom, not only within the confines of the College but\nusing its expertise to reach out into the wider profession to support our colleagues in both the maintained and private sectors\nof education.\nThe College continues to value the relationship that it has with its partnership Schools in the Inspire Teaching School Alliance.\nInspire is a group of like-minded schools working in partnership with two local universities to provide teachers with the skills\nand experience to become outstanding practitioners at any stage in their career. The Alliance has a particular focus on\nSchools Direct as a pathway into the teaching profession and in January 2015 Hurst organised and hosted a very successful\ntraining day for all of the School Direct trainees. We were also able to offer a second placement to one of the primary\ntrainees. Several of our staff are members of the various strategic committees within the Alliance.\nOur record for offering training to new and aspiring members of the profession continues to grow. The year saw 8 Newly\nQualified Teachers successfully complete their induction year under the umbrella of the Independent Schools Teacher\nInduction Panel. In February ISTIP inspected our NQT provision and judged the induction policy as excellent, with all NQTs\ndeemed to be focussed, engaged, and feeling very well supported. Alongside the NQTs, the College also committed to fully-\nfunding the Buckingham University PGCE course for two members of staff. The College also employed a number of\nunqualified junior teachers, whose development was supported through one-to-one mentoring, observations and INSET.\nStrong links remain between Hurst and Brighton University, from whom we receive PCGE students for either their first or\nsecond placements. Last year we were able to offer 3 placements across Art, Geography and Dance. Alongside our other\ntrainee teachers, all PGCE placement students are offered a programme of targeted INSET to further develop their practice.\nIn June, the Head of Geography hosted a forum for Geography Heads from the ‘14Group’ of schools, providing an opportunity\nto share best practice and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the forthcoming GCSE and ‘A’ level curriculum\nchanges.\nCommunity Hurst\nThe College is a part of a wider community and we are keen that our staff and pupils participate.\nIn 2015 the College was again actively involved in the local Arts Festival, staging Hurst productions as well as offering facilities,\nvehicles and equipment for festival use; and it also supported numerous local community service activities. In addition, links\nhave been formed with Warden Park, a local maintained school, and we have supported a number of joint ventures with this\nschool.\nBy developing and providing public access to new facilities, the College remains at the heart of the community. Facilities made\navailable to the public include:\nOur sports facilities, which are recognised as being of particular quality and are regularly used by numerous clubs and\norganisations including Brighton & Hove Albion FC (including Sussex Seagulls), Burgess Hill Football Club, Burgess Hill\nTown Ladies FC, Ditchling Cricket Club, Ditchling RFC, England Hockey, First Class Cricket Coaching, Headliners\nCricket, Henfield Cricket Club, Horsham Cricket & Sports Club, Hurst Colts, Hurstpierpoint Cricket Club, Hurst\nHornets FC, Hurstpierpoint Ladies Football Club, Hurstpierpoint Tennis Club, Hurstpierpoint Womens Cricket Club,\nKeymer and Hassocks Cricket Club, Mid Sussex Hockey Club, Mid Sussex Netball Club, Pure Cricket Academy, the\nRugby Football Union, St Andrew's Cricket Club, Sussex Bujin Kan (martial arts training), Sussex County Cricket Club,\nSussex County Hockey, Sussex County Netball Association, Sussex County Rugby, Sussex Martlets cricket, Sussex Netball\nClub, Sussex Nomads cycling club, Sussex RFU, Top Hats and Tutus dance club and Twineham & Wineham Cricket Club.\nThe College minibus fleet, which has been used to support the Brighton Marathon, the Longines Royal International Horse\nShow and also provided ad hoc assistance to Brighton 29th Scout Troop, Lindfield Boys Brigade, Lindfield Primary School,\nLindfield URC youth group, Southwater Scout Troop and Sussex County Netball Club.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n14\nThe College swimming pool, which is made available to local swimming clubs and organised bodies including 1st Swim\nSchool, Floaters Sports Management, Flippers and Fins, Southdown Lifesavers and Simply Swim.\nOur Chapel, which is open to the public during all services.\nSussex Pages Ltd, a business networking organisation held an event in the dining hall\nThe College grounds, which were made available to Woodlands Meed School for a sponsored walk\nThe sports hall and other facilities, which are used by the Sussex Guild, a self-help organisation for professional designers\nand makers of fine contemporary and traditional craftwork, for their major area show.\nIn addition, during school holiday periods, College facilities were made available to Sussex Police for dog team training and\nfor training sessions run by West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.\nWe also run a choral society for parents and members of the local community; and the College and Prep School Jazz Bands,\nChoirs and other groups regularly perform at charity and fund-raising events across the locality; while numerous arts events\nat the College – including plays, concerts and dance performances – are open to the public.\nWider Charitable Activity\nAs well as supporting the local community through community service activities – including conservation, helping in old\npeople’s homes and youth residential centres – the College community takes part in a wide range of sponsored events and\nother fundraising activities. During the year, through the efforts of pupils, parents and staff, the College raised over £27,000\nfor various charities.\nIn addition to this a team of Senior School pupils raised funds for the building of a school building in a remote village in Malawi.\nThey also raised funds for their own expenses and went to the location to help with its construction. In June all the Senior\nSchool pupils spent a day on various projects in the local area helping charitable and educational causes.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW AND RESULTS FOR 2014/15\nIn financial terms 2014/15 was another very successful year. Net fee income rose by modest 2.0% as a result of a the slight\ndecline in pupil numbers, an increase in fee concessions and fee increases of 3% – once again below the increases imposed by\nmany of our competitors.\nCosts were generally well contained, although these were inflated by a number of factors, primarily increased spending on\nteachers’ salaries, IT and transport, and overall resources expended increased by 2.7%, slightly ahead of the 1.8% increase in\nincoming resources. Expenditure on discretionary building projects fell by 53% to £532,000, as financial resources were\nretained for the two major capital projects which started in early 2015.\nAs a consequence of this and aided by a further £510,000 income from Activities for Generating Funds – primarily income\nfrom lettings – net incoming resources remained extremely positive at £2.42M, only slightly down on the previous year’s high.\nAs a result, operating cash-flow was once again extremely positive and sufficient to fund further capital expenditure of £3.09M\nduring the year.\nOur main trading Company, Hurst Facilities Limited, continues to hire out College facilities during vacations and school hours,\nas well as undertaking commercial activity on behalf of the school and externally (although the main educational letting is\nundertaken by the charity itself). The Company contributed the sum of £33,000 to the College’s operating surplus in 2014/15.\nThe parents of our pupils often make significant sacrifices to pay the fees. In doing so they help to relieve the state of the\nfinancial burden of educating over 1,000 UK-based children. This saving to the state is estimated to have a value in the last\nyear of £6.3M.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n15\nThe school is unable to recover the VAT on purchases it makes. During the past year, the College has paid an estimated\n£1.45M in VAT on goods and services.\nDevelopment of the College Estate\nOver the year expenditure on improvements to College facilities totalled a further £3.26M: including £1.3M on the extension\nto the science block; £1.0M on the extension to the classroom block; £186,000 on repairs to the College’s original listed\nbuildings (the latest phase of an on-going programme); £200,000 on facilities to accommodate the Colleges Estates teams;\n£101,000 on a new gymnasium; over £130,000 on improvements to boarding houses and £76,000 on improvements to the\nCollege’s historic cricket pavilion.\nInvestment Performance Against Objectives\nThe Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association permit funds to be invested in such manner as the directors see\nfit, provided that such powers of investment are only exercised for the purpose of attaining the objects and in a manner that\nis legally charitable. The governing body’s policy is to preserve the capital value of investments and maximise the return on\nall investments.\nThe College’s investments are managed by UBS Wealth Management and in the opinion of the advisers the performance has\nbeen satisfactory. The investment performance is measured against targets provided by our investment advisers. Stock\nmarket conditions showed a continued improvement over the course of the year and the investment return on the College’s\nfunds, which are now held in the UBS Resolution Income Fund, for the 12 months to 31 August 2015 was 7.81% compared\nwith the benchmark performance target return of 9.14% .\nReserves Policy\nIn common with most independent schools, the Charity’s unrestricted reserves are primarily invested in tangible fixed assets,\nwhich are all used for its direct charitable activities. This utilisation of funds is essential to ensure that high quality up-to-date\nfacilities are available for the benefit of pupils and in order to meet the increasing expectations of our parents. The Directors\nconsider that given the strength of the company’s balance sheet, the stable cash flow from full student rolls, the ongoing\npopularity of the College, and the available banking facility that can be called upon if need arises, there is no need to build up\na free reserve.\nFUTURE PLANS\nStrategic Objectives\nThe Board’s strategic plan was approved in early September 2014 and is reviewed on an annual basis. The key objectives of\nthe current plan are:\n\nTo maintain pupil numbers at the present level for both financial as well as educational reasons;\n\nTo raise academic standards and create a successful and vibrant academic environment throughout the College and to\nfoster academic entrepreneurship at every level;\n\nTo recruit high quality pupils to the College;\n\nTo strengthen the boarding ethos and maintain the number of boarders at the College by increasing the number and\nstandard of extra-curricular activities and improving the boarding provision;\n\nTo further develop key facilities across the Campus;\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n16\n\nTo widen public access to the College and its resources; and\n\nTo provide appropriate support to the Woodard Corporation in pursuit of its charitable objectives.\nObjectives for 2015/16\nDuring 2015/16, the College intends to:\n\nComplete the revision of the curriculum across the College to accommodate the revised GCSE and A level courses and\nensure that all pupils benefit from a coherent, linear academic programme;\n\nIntroduce a programme of curricular and extra-curricular activities to foster the academic development of the most able\npupils in the College;\n\nReview the boarding provision at the College and develop a strategy for its development;\n\nReview and restructure the College’s marketing activities and branding, including launching an improved website;\n\nEmbed and extend the provision of mobile technology use in and out of the classroom;\n\nComplete the development of the central academic axis at the College and plan for the next phase of campus\ndevelopment.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nRisk Management\nThe Directors are responsible for the identification and management of risks. Detailed examination of the risks is delegated\nto the relevant committee, which works with the Senior Management Team to identify risks and establish controls to mitigate\nthem. A formal review of the risk management process and judgements is undertaken annually by the complete governing\nbody.\nPrincipal Risks Facing the Charity\nThe principal risks to which the College is exposed include those affecting protection of pupils and security and preservation\nof charitable assets both now and in the future.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and in the preceding year are:\na. Basis of Accounting\nThe accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice ‘Accounting\nand Reporting by Charities’ and with applicable UK accounting standards. They are drawn up on the historical cost\naccounting basis except that investments held as fixed assets are carried at market value. Financial Reporting Standard 102,\nand a revised Statement of Recommended Practice for Charity Accounting will be applicable for the school’s financial\nstatements ending 31 August 2016.\nb. Going Concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors of the charitable Company review the financial\ninformation for the charity and the group, and consider whether the charity and group are going concerns for a period of at\nleast 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable\nexpectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.\nc. Group Accounts\nThe financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company, and all its subsidiary companies, charitable\ntrusts and funds with all inter-company balances being eliminated.\nd. Fees and Similar Income\nFees receivable are accounted for in the period in which the service is provided. Fees receivable are stated after deducting\nallowances, scholarships and other remissions granted by the school, but include contributions received from Restricted\nFunds for scholarships, bursaries and other grants. Fees in Advance are those fees received in advance of the following\nyear’s education and are shown as a short term liability until taken to income in accordance with this policy.\nAdvance Fees are those fees received in advance of education to be provided in future years under an Advance Fees Contract\nwhich are held as interest bearing liabilities until either taken to income in the term when used, or else refunded.\ne. Trading Activity and Ancillary Trading Activity\nIncome from holiday and sports hall lettings are recognised in the SOFA activities when the services are provided.\nf. Donations and Appeals\nDonations, subject to the specific wishes of the donors, are credited to relevant restricted funds or to endowed funds where\nthe amount is required to be held as permanent capital. Donations received for the general purposes of the school are\ncredited to other unrestricted funds, to distinguish them from direct school income.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n26\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nOn occasions the school may set up an appeal to raise finance at times when particular projects are being undertaken.\nMonies received are treated in accordance with the terms of the appeal documentation and are recognised as Designated\nFunds and shown under ‘Unrestricted Funds’ in the SOFA, rather than as Restricted Funds. Appeal documentation explains\nthat monies can be used for general purposes.\ng. Expenditure\nExpenditure is allocated to expense headings either on a direct cost basis or apportioned according to time spent. The\nirrecoverable element of VAT is included with the item of expense to which it relates.\nThe cost of refurbishing and converting existing buildings is written-off in the year in which it is incurred except where the\nuseful life has been extended. Bad debts are provided for in accordance with the group bad debt policy.\nh. Governance Costs\nGovernance costs include the costs attributable to Hurstpierpoint College’s compliance with constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, including audit, strategic management and govern ors’ meetings and reimbursed expenses. Such costs include\nboth direct and allocated support costs.\ni. Finance and Other Costs\nOther costs include amounts accrued in accordance with the terms of Advance Fee Contracts.\nj. Pension Costs\nThe Company participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (‘the TPS’), an unfunded Government\nscheme, for its teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate\nto consistently identify the liabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the Company. As required by Financial Reporting\nStandard (‘FRS’) 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company accounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe company offers membership of the Pensions Trust Growth Plan to all the employees other than the full-time academic\nstaff. The Pensions Trust Growth Plan is a multi-employer pension scheme where the scheme assets are pooled for\ninvestment purposes and cannot be attributed to individual employers. Benefits are paid from the total scheme assets. It is\nin most respects a money purchase arrangement, but has some guarantees. As a result it is not possible or appropriate to\nidentify the assets and liabilities of the scheme which are attributable to the company, though, due to the guarantees inherent\nin the scheme, the companies remain potentially liable for a debt on withdrawal from the scheme. In accordance with FRS\n17 therefore, the scheme is accounted for in a fashion which is similar to a defined contribution scheme. More detail is given\nin notes 26 and 27.\nThe company also contributes to other pension schemes for non-teaching staff.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n27\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nk.\nTangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Individual capital items, or projects, with a value greater than\n£10,000 are capitalised. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. They are\ntransferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.\nWhere appropriate, cost includes our own labour costs in relation to construction, and directly attributable overheads.\nWhere tangible fixed assets have been acquired with the aid of specific grants they are included in the balance sheet at cost\nand depreciated over their expected useful economic life. The related grants are credited to a restricted fixed asset fund\n(in the statement of financial activities and carried forward in the balance sheet). The depreciation on such assets is charged\nin the statement of financial activities over the expected useful economic life of the related asset on a basis consistent with\nthe depreciation policy.\nDepreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected\nuseful life, as follows:\nFreehold land is not depreciated\nFreehold buildings:\nwith an expected life over 50 years\n-\nNil\nwith an expected life under 50 years - Variable according to the building and written off over the expected\nuseful life\nunder construction\n-\nNil\nMajor items of plant\n-\n10 years\nComputer equipment\n-\n25% on cost\nFurniture and fittings\n-\n25% on cost\nPlant and equipment\n-\nbetween 4% and 25% on cost\nMotor vehicles\n-\n25% on cost\nThe company has reviewed its tangible assets, which comprise land, buildings and initial fixtures and fittings. Where the\ndirectors consider that the expected useful life is in excess of 50 years and the carrying value in the financial statements is\nnot more than the estimated recoverable amount, no depreciation is charged and, in accordance with FRS11, the directors\nhave and will continue to carry out annual reviews of impairment. The review is based on the directors’ assessments of the\nmarket value and the future economic benefit derived from an asset versus its carrying value in the accounts. Impairment\ncharges are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nk. Investments\nInvestments are carried at market value in accordance with the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and The\nStatement of Recommended Practice ‘Accounting and Reporting by Charities’.\nRealised gains are the difference between sales proceeds and opening market value where the investment was held at the\nbeginning of the year, or sales proceeds less cost of purchase where the investment was acquired in the year.\nUnrealised gains are the change in value of investments after taking into account any movements in investment holdings such\nas purchases and disposals of investments. The revaluation reserve reflects the accumulated total of unrealised gains.\nUninvested cash is the balance of liquid cash, held as an investment, which has not been invested in securities.\n1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n28\nInvestments (Continued)\nRealised and unrealised gains are accounted for within the SOFAs on pages 21 and 22.\nl. Stocks\nStocks comprise raw materials, consumable stores and goods held for resale: they are valued at the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value.\nm. Leasing Commitments\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over\ntheir useful lives or the period of the lease whichever is the shorter. The interest element of the obligations is charged to\nthe SOFA over the period of the lease. Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks\nof ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the SOFA on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nn. Fund Accounts\nEndowment funds are subject to specific conditions by donors that the capital must be maintained by the charity.\nRestricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. The purposes and uses of the\nrestricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\nDesignated funds comprise funds which have been set aside at the discretion of the directors for specific purposes. The\npurposes and uses of the designated funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.\no. Taxation\nHurstpierpoint College Limited is a registered charity and as such is exempt from income tax and corporation tax under the\nprovisions of Section 478 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. There is no similar exemption for VAT, which is included in\nexpenditure or in the cost of assets as appropriate.\nThe School has subsidiary companies that are subject to taxes including corporation tax and VAT in the same way as any\ncommercial organisation. The tax charged to the profit and loss accounts is based on the subsidiary companies’ profits for\nthe year and takes into account tax arising because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and\naccounting purposes. The subsidiary companies pay over the majority of their profits to Hurstpierpoint College Limited\nunder Gift Aid and tax liabilities are kept to a minimum.\np. Cash flow statement\nThe cash flows of Hurstpierpoint College Limited are included in the consolidated cash flow statement of The Woodard\nCorporation. Hurstpierpoint College Limited is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised) from publishing a cash flow\nstatement.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n29\n2.

PENSION SCHEMES\nTeachers’ Pension Scheme\nThe School participates in the Teachers' Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (""the TPS"") for its teaching staff. This is\na multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate to consistently identify the\nliabilities of the TPS which are attributable to the School. As required by FRS17 ""Retirement Benefits"", the School\naccounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\nThe pension charge for the year includes contributions payable to the TPS of £770,932 (2014: £711,151) and at the\nyear-end £63,448 (2014 - £57,141) was accrued in respect of contributions to this scheme.\nThe TPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme governed by the Teachers' Pension Scheme\nRegulations 2014. Membership is automatic for teachers, although they are able to opt out. Members contribute on a\n""pay as you go"" basis with contributions from members and the employer being credited to the Exchequer. Retirement\nand other pension benefits are paid by public funds provided by Parliament.\nThe employer contribution rate is set following scheme valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary Department.\nThe latest valuation report in respect of the TPS was prepared at 31 March 2012 and was published in June 2014. This\nreport confirmed that the employer contribution rate for the TPS will increase from 14.1% to 16.4% although,\nrecognising that teaching establishments work on an academic and not financial year, the Government has deferred the\nimplementation of this increase to 1 September 2015. Employers will in addition from 1 September 2015 pay a scheme\nadministration levy of 0.08% of the employers' salary costs which will increase the total employer payment rate from\n16.4% to 16.48%.\nThe next revision to the employer contribution rate is not expected to take effect until 1 April 2019. This will follow\non from the next actuarial valuation which is due at 31 March 2016. This valuation will also determine the opening\nbalance of the cost cap fund and provide an analysis of the cost cap as required by the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.\nA copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation is on the Teachers’ Pensions website.\nPensions Trust’s Growth Plan\nThe company participates in The Pensions Trust’s Growth Plan (the Plan). The Plan is funded and is not contracted-\nout of the State scheme. The Plan is a multi-employer pension plan. Contributions paid into the Plan up to and including\nSeptember 2001 were converted to defined amounts of pension payable from Normal Retirement Date. From October\n2001 contributions were invested in personal funds which have a capital guarantee and which are converted to pension\non retirement, either within the Plan or by the purchase of an annuity.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n41\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nThe rules of the Plan allow for the declaration of bonuses and/or investment credits if this is within the financial capacity\nof the Plan assessed on a prudent basis. Bonuses/investment credits are not guaranteed and are declared at the\ndiscretion of the Plan’s Trustee.\nThe Trustee commissions an actuarial valuation of the Plan every three years. The purpose of the actuarial valuation is\nto determine the funding position of the Plan by comparing the assets with the past service liabilities as at the valuation\ndate. Asset values are calculated by reference to market levels. Accrued past service liabilities are valued by discounting\nexpected future benefit payments using a discount rate calculated by reference to the expected future investment\nreturns.\nThe rules of the Plan give the Trustee the power to require employers to pay additional contributions in order to\nensure that the statutory funding objective under the Pensions Act 2004 is met. The statutory funding objective is that\na pension scheme should have sufficient assets to meet its past service liabilities, known as Technical Provisions.\nIf the actuarial valuation reveals a deficit, the Trustee will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit over a specified\nperiod of time either by way of additional contributions from employers, investment returns or a combination of these.\nThe rules of the Plan state that the proportion of obligatory contributions to be borne by the member and the member’s\nemployer shall be determined by agreement between them. Such agreement shall require the employer to pay part of\nsuch contributions and may provide that the employer shall pay the whole of them. The Company paid contributions\nat rates of either 6% or 10%, and members paid contributions at rates of either 3% or 5% during the accounting period.\nAs at the balance sheet date there were 125 active members of the Plan employed by the Company. The Company\ncontinues to offer membership of the Plan to its employees.\nIt is not possible in the normal course of events to identify on a reasonable and consistent basis the share of underlying\nassets and liabilities belonging to individual participating employers. The Plan is a multi-employer scheme, where the\nassets are co-mingled for investment purposes, and benefits are paid out of the Plan’s total assets. Accordingly, due to\nthe nature of the Plan, the accounting charge for the period under FRS17 represents the employer contribution payable.\nThe valuation results at 30 September 2011 were completed in 2012 and have been formalised. The valuation of the\nPlan was performed by a professionally qualified Actuary using the Projected Unit Method. The market value of the\nPlan’s assets at the valuation date was £780 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e . past service liabilities) were\n£928 million. The valuation therefore revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of liabilities of £148 million,\nequivalent to a funding level of 84%.\nThe financial assumptions underlying the valuation as at 30 September 2011 were as follows:\n% per annum\nRate of return pre-retirement\n4.9\nRate of return post retirement:\nActive/Deferred\nPensioners\n4.2\n4.2\nBonuses on accrued benefits\n0.0\nInflation: Retail Price Index (RPI)\n2.9\nInflation: Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n2.4\n26 PENSION SCHEMES (Continued)\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n42\nIn determining the investment return assumptions the Trustee considered advice from the Scheme Actuary relating to\nthe probability of achieving particular levels of investment return. The Trustee has incorporated an element of prudence\ninto the pre and post retirement investment return assumptions; such that there is a 60% expectation that the return\nwill be in excess of that assumed and a 40% chance that the return will be lower than that assumed over the next 10\nyears.\nThe Scheme Actuary is currently finalising the 2014 valuation and results will be communicated in due course. At 30\nSeptember 2013, the market value of the Plan’s assets was £772 million and the Plan’s Technical Provisions (i.e . past\nservice liabilities) was £927 million. The update, therefore, revealed a shortfall of assets compared with the value of\nliabilities of £155 million, equivalent to a funding level of 83%.\nIf an actuarial valuation reveals a shortfall of assets compared to liabilities, the Trustee must prepare a recovery plan\nsetting out the steps to be taken to make up the shortfall.\nThe Pensions Regulator has the power under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 to issue scheme funding directions where\nit believes that the actuarial valuation assumptions and/or recovery plan are inappropriate. For example, the Regulator\ncould require that the Trustee strengthens the actuarial assumptions (which would increase the Plan liabilities and hence\nimpact on the recovery plan) or impose a schedule of contributions on the Plan (which would effectively amend the\nterms of the recovery plan). A copy of the recovery plan in respect of the September 2011 valuation was forwarded\nto The Pensions Regulator on 2 October 2012, as is required by legislation.\nFollowing a change in legislation in September 2005 there is a potential debt on the employer that could be levied by\nthe Trustee of the Plan, and The Pensions Act 2011 has more recently altered the definition of Series 3 of the Growth\nPlan so that a liability arises to employers from membership of any Series except Series 4. The debt is due in the event\nof the employer ceasing to participate in the Plan or the Plan winding up. The debt for the Plan as a whole is calculated\nby comparing the liabilities for the Plan (calculated on a buy-out basis i.e . the cost of securing benefits by purchasing\nannuity policies from an insurer, plus an allowance for expenses) with the assets of the Plan. If the liabilities exceed\nassets there is a buy-out debt.\nThe leaving employer’s share of the buy-out debt is the proportion of the Plan’s liability attributable to employment\nwith the leaving employer compared to the total amount of the Plan’s liabilities (relating to employment with all the\ncurrently participating employers). The leaving employer’s debt therefore includes a share of any ‘orphan’ liabilities in\nrespect of previously participating employers. The amount of the debt therefore depends on many factors including\ntotal Plan liabilities, Plan investment performance, the liabilities in respect of current and former employees of the\nemployer, financial conditions at the time of the cessation event and the insurance buy-out market. The amounts of\ndebt can therefore be volatile over time.\nThe Growth Plan is a “last man standing” multi-employer scheme. This means that if a withdrawing employer is unable\nto pay its debt on withdrawal the liability is shared amongst the remaining employers. The participating employers are\ntherefore, jointly and severally liable for the deficit in the Growth Plan. As at 30 September 2013 the total deficit\ncalculated on the buy-out basis was £219.9 million. See note 27 for further details.\nHURSTPIERPOINT COLLEGE LIMITED\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2015\n43\n27. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn common with other charities with employees contributing to the Pensions Trust Growth Plan, the Company has\nbeen informed of potential amounts payable should the Company undertake certain actions, for example significant re-\norganisation, leading to cessation of membership and contributions.\nWhen an employer withdraws from a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme which is in deficit, the employer\nis required by law to pay its share of the deficit, calculated on a statutory basis (known as the buy-out basis), as outlined\nin Note 26. Due to a change in the definition of money purchase contained in the Pensions Act 2011 the calculation\nbasis that applies to the Growth Plan will be amended to include Series 3 liabilities in the calculation of an employer’s\ndebt on withdrawal.\nThe Pensions Act 2011 also proposed regulations which will make “consequential or transitional provisions to avoid\nadverse consequences”. Should an employer withdraw prior to the regulations coming into force (expected to be at\nthe end of July 2014), they should contact The Pensions Trust to check whether the regulations could affect their debt\non withdrawal calculation.\nThe Company has been notified by The Pensions Trust of the estimated employer debt on withdrawal from the Plan\nbased on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 September 2014. As of this date the estimated employer debt for\nthe Company was £607,256, including Series 3 liabilities. These potential liabilities will diminish over time and the\nCompany has no intention to undertake an action which will crystallise the contingent amount.\n28.

Child numbers for September 2017 were low, vrith a total of just 9 children.\nHowever, this mirrors the numbers at the beginning of the last academic year.\nWe have since had further new starters, and expect further children to join in the coming term (commencing Jan 18j, taking our\ntotal to 15.\nWe have 3 members of staff, ag quailed.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe attached financial statements show the current state of the charity's finances.

The Pre-school has no restricted funds, and therefore essentially all cash balances can be considered to be\npart of reserves.\nIn the event of reserves falling significantly below the target level, the Pre-school will aim to restore the reserves as soon as\npossible by postponing salary increases and bonuses, fundraising, increasing earned income by increasing child numbers, or\nreducing expenditure.\nSimilarly, if reserves are signiffcantly above the target level, the Committee will put in place a plan as soon as possible, aiming to\neliminate the excess within two years by spending money to enhance the quality of Pre-school provision, or otherwise further\nthe aims of the Pre-school, or by reduring fundraising.\nThe Committee will not, however, take any steps that might call into question the ability of the Pre-school to continue as a\nfinancially viable operation in the long term. In particular, it will not plan to use excess reserves to cover essential running costs.\nPOUCY REVIEW\nThis policy will be reviewed and approved annually by the Preschool Management Committee.\nReview date: September 2019\nSigned on behalf of the Trustees\nManagement committee chair and secretary\nPage 3\nOcta.\nBreachwood Green Pre-School\nRegistered charity number 1038926\nIndependent examiner's report to the trustees of Breachwood Green Pre School\nFor the year ended 31 December 2017\nI report on the accounts of Breachwood Green Pre School for the year ended 31 December 201 7, which are set\noutonpages 1to6.\nRespeclve responsibilities of trustees and examiner\nThe charity's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts.

The Pre-school has no restricted funds, and therefore essentially all cash balances can be considered to be\npart of reserves.\nIn the event of reserves falling significantly below the target level, the Pre-school will aim to restore the reserves as soon as\npossible by postponing salary increases and bonuses, fundraising, increasing earned income by increasing child numbers, or\nreducing expenditure.\nSimilarly, if reserves are significantly above the target level, the Committee will put in place a plan as soon as possible, aiming to\neliminate the excess within two years by spending money to enhance the quality of Pre-school provision, or otherwise further\nthe aims of the Pre-school, or by reducing fundraising.\nThe Committee will not, however, take any steps that might call into question the ability of the Pre-school to continue as a\nfinancially viable operation in the long term. In particular, it will not plan to use excess reserves to cover essential running costs.\nPOLICY REVIEW\nThis policy will be reviewed and approved annually by the Pre-school Management Committee.\nReview date: September 2019\nSigned on behalf of the Trustees\nComeye\nDate:\nEmme Romaya\nManagement Committee Chair and Secretary\nPage 3\nBreachwood Green Pre-School\nRegistered charity number 1038926\nIndependent examiner's report to the trustees of Breachwood Green Pre School\nFor the year ended 31 December 2017\nI report on the accounts of Breachwood Green Pre School for the year ended 31 December 2017, which are set\nout on pages 1 to 6.\nRespective responsibilities of trustees and examiner\nThe charity's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts.

The Church's\nmission is to enable people to become fully devoted followers of jesus\nChrist by the power of the Holy Spirit. To that end, we understand the\npurposes of the Church to be worship, discipleship, fellowship, outreach\nand service. The fellowship of the Church seeks to go deeper with God,\nbecome closer to each other and wider in our influence.\nObjectives and Overview\nThe Church is committed to carrying out its activities in line with the\nBaptist tradition and to encourage and enable people in the local area to\nattend and take part in its services and meetings. Activities include:\n~\nServices each week for worship, prayer, Bible study, preaching and\nteaching, including additional services for those in the local area\nwhose first language is not English\n~\nBaptisms on request\n~\nMeetings for young people\n~\nSmall group meetings (LIFE Groups) for all ages\n~\nPastoral care\n~\nDiscipleship for Christian service\n~\nEvangelism and mission\n~\nSupport of Christian and social charitable action within the local\narea\n~\nSupport for mission overseas\n~\nInvolvement with the local and national Baptist associations\nThe ministry areas of the Church are classified into Worship,\nFellowship, Reaching Out, Discipleship and Social Action, supplemented by\na Resources Team (all led by the Deacons) and with spiritual oversight\nand pastoral care administered by the Elders.\nChurch Activities\nWorship, Teaching and Prayer\nOur Sunday morning service of worship continues to be the largest\nevent in the Church's life and the point when the Church Community\ncomes together. In 2017 we began to see a growing number of people in\nmembership but fewer people attending on a weekly basis. This seems to\nreflect the pressures on people's lives to spread themselves between\nmany different needs. Consequently the average number of weekly\nattenders was slightly lower but the total number of worshippers grew. As\nbefore a greater number are attending during the main festivals, with our\nnumbers peaking on Easter Day and for our Carol Service. In addition to\nour morning service we also have a smaller Sunday evening service and a\nSunday afternoon Portuguese language service. In 2017 in the mornings\nwe looked at:\nCultivating a healthy soul\nBecoming Missionary Disciples\nActs 1-8\nMatthew 5-6\nRecovering the Image of God\nAn Advent series thinking of God's love coming to us\nIn the evenings we looked at:\nGalatians\nIsaiah\nJames\nAs previously, a committed team of worship leaders and the preaching\nteam are involved in leading services. Our Senior Minister took a time of\nsabbatical during which various guest speakers were involved. We once\nagain ran a series of 'Deeper' in the spring; offering a more interactive\napproach than a typical evening service, with in-depth teaching entitled:\n'What good is the Law' followed by small group discussion. On the second\nSunday evening of each month we have continued to run our informal\n'Refresh' service. During the year we also had the opportunity to hold\nservices for a local school and our local Mencap centre.\nVarious members of the congregation lead prayer in services and people\ncan also seek personal prayer after each service. We have a dedicated\nPrayer Room and prayers are held there weekdays at noon. Prayer is a\nvital component of our small group meetings during the week. Prayer\nBreakfasts have been held during the year with differing formats and\nstyles. These have been made family friendly so they provide a good\nopportunity for people of all ages to come and enjoy fellowship and pray\nin an informal setting.\nDiscipleship\nA new Deacon to head up Discipleship was appointed in March 2017,\nwith the aim of building a culture of discipleship in various forms. The\nChurch strategy is primarily to promote and develop small groups, which\nare designed to be an informal space where members can build\nrelationships, deepen faith and grow as disciples. During the year, these\ngroups were rebranded as LIFE Groups to better reflect their purpose\nwhich is to share the life that Jesus gives in a smaller setting. The\ngroup leaders met together twice in 2017 to encourage each other, share\nideas, discuss challenges, consider the future development of the\ngroups, and how to grow group attendance. A survey of non-attenders\nwas carried out in November. Encouragement to the congregation to\nattend groups continues to be given in morning services. A new group\nhas been established to nurture new Christians who have been through\nthe Alpha course that the Church runs. The group notice board and\nChurch web site have been also updated to reflect the changes.\nA new men's ministry is under consideration to enable informal\ncross-generational mentoring and spiritual growth. This is seen as\nparticularly valuable for the younger adults, but would benefit all\nthose involved through the building of relationships. Mutual\naccountability partnerships for men and women are also being promoted\nacross the wider Church.\nOrganisation of the Church library has progressed with the removal\nof dated or duplicated books. Modern study and reference books have\nbeen purchased which are for the use of LIFE group leaders and those\nwho may need resources for sermon preparation. The purchase of\nfurther books is planned, and the overhaul of group resources continues.\nRegular book promotions and the sale of books to make printed resources\nas accessible as possible are intended. Bible reading notes are also\navailable for children, young people and adults with the opportunity to\ntry out the notes before buying.\nXnternational Ministry\nIn June, we celebrated our 10th Anniversary of the International\nMinistry and give thanks for God's faithfulness over the years.\nGustavo Gubiani has been appointed as International Ministry Leader,\nbut Tracy Moreton is still very much engaged and responsible for\ndeveloping Language Programmes and International Events.\n'Cafe and\nCompanhia' has proved very successful with between 10 and 20 ladies\nattending.\n'International Cafe' was launched in November, planned as a\nmonthly activity. Students from the language programme have attended\nboth events which provides an opportunity for bridge building. This year\nmost of the students are from the local community. Both initiatives are\nfocusing on reaching out.\nThe Portuguese speaking congregation has been experiencing a deeper\nknowledge of Christ, that is gradually being reflected in their walk with\neach other and society. The weekly Portuguese Service has an attendance\nof between 20-30 (adults and children) and has become well known by\nothers. Alongside the services, discipleship classes and pastoral care is\nbeing given. Marcela Gubiani assists in this ministry and helps with the\nladies (outreach and care) and teaching of the children. A Portuguese LIFE\ngroup has started once a week, as another way to connect with people\noutside the Church building, enabling the group to pray together, support\neach other and use their gifts.\nThe International Ministry continues with the vision to draw people in\nfrom the wider town community and is very effective in aiding the\nInternational Community to feel fully included in the Church family.\nSocial Action\nOur focus is to engage with our local community and make a difference\nthrough our four aims:\nSupporting those in need, particularly the poorer in society and\nthose struggling financially.\nSupporting community groups who meet specific needs in our local\narea.\nCaring for the local environment.\nFellowship.\nA wide variety of social action projects have been ongoing throughout\nthe year, including the Bishops Stortford Money Advice Service. However,\nhighlights and changes during 2017 were:\nExchange —we have been working mainly with the local Children' s\nCentre this year and have been able to help two people with furniture\nstorage after they had been made homeless.\nBishops Stortford Food Bank —a new co-ordinator has been appointed\nand will be increasing the opening times from 3 days to 4 in February\n2018.\nToddlers —Remains very popular, and many of the Toddlers families\nhave also attended Messy Church.\nYMCA —is now part of YMCA East Herts, so the manager has moved on\nand a new management team is in place.\nStreet Pastors —Has a new co-ordinator and has teams going out most\nFriday evenings.\nGrove Cottage —We are hoping that the Puppets Galore team will be\nable to run some sessions at Grove Cottage, and we may be able to help\nthe Grove Cottage Life Skills Coach to find useful work experience for their\nmembers.\nCanal Adoption —Our Waterways Chaplain has now moved away to\nNewbury to minister on the waterways there, but we are still working with\nthe Canal fk River Trust to maintain and improve the canal by the Church.\nReaching Out\nOverview\nWe continue to seek to weave the thread of evangelism through all\nour Church ministry areas and activities, to draw people closer to God and\ngive the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Him. Our Church\nbuilding, our Services, our welcome and fellowship, should all reflect\nChrist's Love. We also look to extend a wider influence in the local\ncommunity, as we try to draw a diverse selection of people into our\npremises, and as we also hold a variety of events at different venues\naround the area.\nL cork\nWe ran an Alpha course again this year with one guest, who has gone on\nto be baptised, become a Church member and join one of our LIFE\nGroups.\nFitness —Circuit Training classes for both sexes are running on Monday\nevenings with a core class of 12. Approximately half the class do not\nattend the Church, although some of them are friends of Church\nmembers.\nFlower Arranging continues as an occasional course with The Lonely\nBouquet Scheme now established as a successful spin-off, by putting\nany left-over blooms to good use. This year, other churches in the town\nwere invited to join together over Easter, to cover our community with\nLonely Bouquets. In spite of relatively short notice, two other churches\ntook part, and we hope to build on this in the future.\nMessy Church. We had two successful events this year, at Easter and\nHalloween. Over 100 people attended both, which were much enjoyed.\nThis year included the ever-popular puppets, as well as flower arranging\nand also two new activities, a 'Bake Off' and 'Lego Master Builder'; both\nproved very successful. Many of those who attended would not normally\ncome along to a church service.\nTable Tennis —this continues as a youth event with participating\nnumbers, but not enthusiasm, gradually dropping over the year. The\nintroduction of a short Biblical talk in the half-time break, has now become\nestablished and provokes more discussion and participation.\n~Wor\nM~ii n\nSome while ago, the Church committed 10% of a large legacy that it\nreceived to overseas mission work, and specifically for work in Rwanda.\nWe have now agreed a partnership with Tearfund for Church Led\nCommunity Transformation in the Vivante Huye Local Church and\nTumba Community in Rwanda. This is a three-year project and\nmeasures have been agreed for this to be closely monitored with quarterly\nreports from Tearfund on progress, visits from Tearfund speakers to\nprovide updates and visits to the project by Church members.\nFor Mission Sunday, in May, we had the honour to have David Kerrigan,\nthe retiring Leader of BMS World Mission come and speak to us about\ntheir newly published Mission Development Programme, set to achieve its\nintended ambitious goals by 2020. We were complemented on our faithful\nfinancial support for BMS, where we fall into the top 10% of contributing\nchurches.\nWe continue to support Roland fk Carolien Smith and their work with\nEuropean Christian Mission in the Netherlands, Eric and Claire\nSingirankabo in Rwanda and Lizzie and Paul Reed seeking to continue\ntheir work in Russia. We have links with Kate 8a Storly Michel\nministering to Haiti.\nWe have also adopted BMS missionaries Sergio and Liz Vilela, working\nwith youth and children in Mozambique. We support them through our\ncontribution to BMS World Mission and also get regular prayer updates\nand access to their blogs via our website. Previously they were both youth\npastors at Saffron Waldon Baptist Church and Liz also worked with Stort\nValley Schools Trust, to which we are closely connected.\nOur family Harvest Service related to BMS World Mission this year too,\nwhere we highlighted the work being done in Thailand with severely\ndisabled children who cannot be cared for by their families. Titled\n'Wonderfully Made' and portraying the children as 'Super Heroes', our\nSunday Club classes really got behind the theme, and with the help of\ntheir leaders, contributed much to the success of the service. We were\nvery much encouraged by the efforts of one little girl, who later went on\nto organise a cake sale to raise funds for this cause too.\nFellowship (2017)\nOverview\nIt has been very encouraging over the past year to see how the fellowship\nof believers at the Church is deepening its commitment to each other and\nto the wider community.\nThe new 'Friends Together' initiative on the second and fourth Friday of\nevery month at Caffe Nero is meeting a need for informal fellowship and\nan opportunity to bring other friends along. There is a core group of\npeople from the Church who are committed to supporting it. Besides\nregular attenders, over the months many people have popped in and\nspent time over tea or coffee, broadening friendships and getting to know\nmore about each other, understanding needs and giving support.\nIt is hoped that the planned Cafe at the Church 'Breaking Bread' on a\nTuesday afternoon will fulfil a similar need, as well as providing a safe\nplace to enjoy fellowship with each other and the local community. The\nnew furniture in the Gathering Area is intended to make the environment\nmore welcoming and purposeful. New noticeboards have been installed to\ngive information on the different areas of the Church's work and a new\ndisplay counter with leaflets advertising and promoting what we do is soon\nto be installed.\nAn extended welcome team are set to begin an approach whereby\nnewcomers can enjoy a welcoming fellowship lunch, together with existing\nmembers and worshippers who have a heart for hospitality.\nThe Baptist Women's Link (BWL) continues to thrive with ladies (and\nsome gentlemen) enjoying fellowship. The members enjoy varied talks\nand activities, lifts are organised, special occasions (such as the Christmas\ncard sale, lunches and teas) are catered for, and members are visited at\nother times of the week - all a regular feature of this group. Our\ncommitted leader over several years, Sheila Vernon, is stepping down in\nApril 2018 and a new leader is needed for September 2018 onwards.\nThe Contact Group continues to provide valuable fellowship to our folk\nwho are elderly and unable to get out of their homes. Together with BWL\nthey had a very enjoyable Summer outing to The Gardens of Easton\nLodge in July which was only made possible due to our volunteer mini-bus\ndrivers and the ladies who prepared a delicious tea at the Church. This\ntruly reflects the quality of our fellowship here, that so many people are\nprepared to give of their time to facilitate a welcome treat for these\npeople.\nChildren and Youth (2017)\nThe children and youth work continued positively with a fantastic team\nof committed leaders. On a Sunday morning we have regular contact with\nabout 100 children and young people (mainly children with parents in\nChurch), where we learn about God's word for us, how we get to know\nhim, and how we can follow his will for our lives. During the week we\ncontinued with the various youth clubs where we see many other young\npeople from the local area come to get to know us and hear something of\nhow God loves them.\nOne or two activities, such as GROW and the parent workshops,\nstopped during the year where we felt they had run their course or where\nwe used our resources elsewhere. However we had the joy of seeing\nYouth Church start where, once or twice a term, alongside the main\nmorning service there is a separate service for the young people to come\ntogether for worship, learning, discussion and prayer. Seeing some of the\nyoung people from Zone (the Friday evening club) come along to this has\nbeen tremendous.\nAlso this year Heather Martin and Beth Walford have started a\nDiscipleship Group for the older girls, who share a meal together with time\nand space to relax, chat, ask questions and provide support for one\nanother.\nWe await the appointment of a new Associate Minister who will have\noversight of the work. In the meantime special mention should once again\nbe made of Heather for her enthusiasm and commitment to the young\npeople and to Jo Moore for her skillful organisation of, and unwavering\nsupport to, the volunteer leaders. This includes ensuring the Safeguarding\nPolicy is kept up to date, rigorously adhered to and training provided, to\nensure the safety of our children and leaders.\nFuture Plans\nA number of aims have been identified for developing the Church and\nits work in 2018:\n~\nContinuing to build a Purpose Driven Church and grow people in\nChristian life and service as missionary disciples.\n~\nThe appointment of an Associate Minster to strengthen our ministry\nteam, provide oversight of our youth work and assist with the many\ninitiatives that are developing\n~\nPhase 2 of the development of the Church site. We intend to agree\nthe vision and outline concept before moving forward to obtaining\ndrawings and plans for a new second building on the site This is a\nlong-term project and teams of people will be formed to take this\nforward.\n~\nLIFE Group attendance. This has fallen over the past few years and\nattempts will be made to get much greater involvement.\n~\nHallingbury Free Church. The Church administers this chapel and\nmanse in a local village. The work is dormant and a decision will be\nmade about its future.\nExternal Links\nThe Church continues to be linked in fellowship to the national\nstructures of the Baptist Union of Great Britain which are expressed locally\nthrough the Eastern Baptist Association.\nThe Church also remains a member of Churches Together in Bishop' s\nStorfford, the Evangelical Alliance and the Willow Creek Association.\nChurch members take part in the meetings and events of Churches\nTogether and support a number of joint projects. These include Holiday\nBible Week, Street Pastors and 'Thirst' Youth Cafe. Churches also meet\ntogether for a service on Good Friday and for prayer at various times.\nPremises\nWe continue to have a significant property holding and liability which is\nmanaged by a small group of volunteers. The budgetary requirement\ncontinues to be under scrutiny, as we are now starting to see\nelements of the Church Centre where we need to start to consider\nreplacement. To keep to overall budgetary constraints however, we have\nnot yet been making regular provision for such end of life replacements,\nbut we have managed single allocations to these reserves from end-of-\nyear surpluses, so far totalling E10,000.\nThe Church Centre\nSome design proposals have been made to provide safe access to the\nroof as we need to make easier arrangements for clearing of gutters etc.\nin the future. We hope to finalise this in 2018.\nSome paving has been laid in a small grass area at the side of the\nChurch Centre, mainly replacing some dead turfs, so that better use can\nbe made of this space.\nA team of dedicated gardeners continue to maintain the grounds, for\nwhich we are very grateful.\nThere have been numerous minor maintenance issues throughout the\nyear, some needing to call on specific talents or employing specialist\ncompanies.\nWe ask Church attendees to advise of any issues that they become\naware of that need attention, so that we can keep the buildings up to a\nhigh standard. We also like to know of any individuals with gifting relating\nto buildings; God has already provided for our needs, but he does call\neach one of us to offer those gifts back to him.\nThe second building on the site\nThe small offices in the left of this building are being used to some\ndegree to house the language classes and 'Exchange'. The\nremainder of the block remains un-useable due to a lack of safe power\nsupply, lighting or heating which would need considerable investment and\nawaits the development of the finalisation of the vision for this area.\nThe Church Manse\nThere have been some minor issues which needed to be resolved,\nparticularly with regard to the shower and some flooring problems. In the\nnear future we may need to consider updating the bathrooms.\nChurch Membership\nThere has been appreciable growth in membership during the year.\nThe year started with 227 members and ended with 235. We have been\nencouraged by 14 applications for membership whilst only 6 have left; 1\nthrough death, 1 because of infirmity and the remaining 4 have left the\narea.\nWe have been further encouraged by 11 requests for baptism during\nthe year, 7 of whom came into membership and a further 2 have asked\nand we expect them to become members shortly. Of the remainder 1 has\nleft the area temporarily to undergo training.\nWorthy of particular note is that the age profile of Church members\nhas dropped significantly. In recent years the normal distribution has been\ncentred on the 50-60 age group but as the graph below shows this is now\non the 40-50 group.\n60\nBishop's Storfford Baptist Church\nMembership by Age as at December 2017\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\nti;.j:"","",l~+g'4, cj,bi .\n~\n-'1~v\n0.i\n.""l ~,\ng fNe\n„-egg~,~~j!;\n0\n10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60 -69 70-79 80-89 90+\n'Discover BSBC' groups have again been held for newcomers to the\nChurch to find out more about its beliefs, practices, priorities and\nactivities. These are informal and interactive sessions during which people\ncan also learn the importance of membership within Baptist churches,\nwhere governance is the responsibility of the gathered membership. On\ncompletion of the 3 sessions attendees can decide whether they wish to\napply to become members of the Church. Three 'Discover BSBC' groups\nwere held in May, June and November with a total of 14 attendees.\nStaff and Volunteers\nWe are extremely grateful to the paid staff team who look after the\nChurch Centre and its multitude of activities for the church and\ncommunity each day: John Walford (Senior Minister), Tim Kingston\nHepner (Church Centre Manager), Jo Moore (Personal Assistant to the\nMinisters), Liz Lake (Church Publicist). We hope to appoint an Associate\nMinister in 2018.\nBut nothing would happen effectively either without the enormous\nteam of volunteers that serve so faithfully in a committed and enthusiastic\nfashion. So many of our members are involved in one way or another.\nAdditionally we pay tribute to the Trustees who have stood down in\n2017 either at the end of their term of office or because of personal\ncircumstances or commitments elsewhere: Keith Bintley, Jonathan\nKisenyi, Trevor McKenzie, Vicki Sweeney, Graham Vernon, Mark Wheeler.\nFinancial Overview\nAll monies received are donations from members and other persons\nassociated with the Church. A small sum is received from the hiring of\npremises to other organisations.\nOverall, planned giving through envelopes and weekly offerings\n(including casual cash gifts) showed an increase compared with the\nprevious year, whereas direct giving by Standing Order decreased.\nOrganisations using the Church Centre for various functions led to\nf11,329 in fees being received.\nTotal receipts for the General Fund (including Gift Aid) were 6342, 605,\nan increase over the equivalent giving in 2016 (f334,241).\nA total of F75, 222 was given to Mission, to similar ministries to 2016.\nOnce Gift Aid had been claimed for the entire year, there was an excess of\nreceipts over payments for the year of f28, 323.92\n62, 675 was spent on such items as additional furniture for the\nGathering Area, signage, shelving and other equipment. 660,000 was\nmade towards repayment of the Baptist Union Corporation loan for the\nChurch Centre construction cost, so that the amount outstanding is now\nf411,093.70. The loan is to be paid back over a period of 15 years, by\n2026.\nThe September Church Meeting decided to commit to financial and\nprayerful support for Tearfund's Church Led Community Transformation\nProject in Vivante Huye Local Church and Tumba Community in Rwanda.\nThe financial commitment is to contribute 627, 763 each November (from\n2017 -2019) from our Special Gifts Fund. This Fund will need a further\nf21,791.32 to be added in order to be able to fully meet this commitment.\nAs at 31st December 2017 the General Reserve stood at E144,140.\nThe Capital Goods Reserve stood at f20, 183. The monies held for the\nChurch Centre, Special Projects and gifts towards purchasing the\nremainder of the site (including the remainder of funds held following the\nsale of 37 Hum Grove in 2015) totalled f180,253.\nThe Church has a Reserves Policy and a minimum sum is stipulated\nwithin this and held within the General Reserve. The amount is sufficient\nfor meeting obligations in a three-month period should the Church have to\nbe wound up.\nWorkplace Pensions —Automatic Enrolment\nThe Church is an employer participating in a pension scheme known as\nthe Baptist Ministers' Pension Scheme (""the Scheme"" ). The Scheme is a\nseparate legal entity which is administered by the Pension Trustee (Baptist\nPension Trust Limited). This satisfies our legal requirement for pension\nprovision for our employees.\nThe Minister and all members of the church staff are eligible to join the\nScheme, which is not contracted out of the State Second Pension.\nFrom january 2012, pension provision is being made through the Defined\nContribution (DC) Plan within the Scheme. In general, members of the\nMinisters' section of the scheme pay 8% of their Pensionable Income and\nemployers pay 6% of members' Pensionable Income into individual\npension accounts, which are operated and managed on behalf of the\nPension Trustee by Legal and General Life Assurance Society Limited. In\naddition, the employer pays a further 4% of Pensionable Income (or 3% if\nthe employer is in the segregated DC section) to cover Death in Service\nBenefits, administration costs, and an associated insurance policy which\nprovides income protection for Scheme members in the event that they\nare unable to work due to long-term incapacity. This income protection\npolicy has been insured by the Baptist Union of Great Britain with Unum\nLimited.\nOur non-ministerial employees are eligible to join the Basic section of\nthe scheme. Members of the Basic Section pay contributions of 5% of\nPensionable Income, and their employers also pay a total of 5%.\nBenefits in respect of service prior to 1 january 2012 are provided\nthrough the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan within the Scheme. The main\nbenefits for pre-2012 service were a defined benefit pension of one\neightieth of Final Minimum Pensionable Income for each year of\nio\nPensionable Service, together with additional pension in respect of\npremiums paid on Pensionable Income in excess of Minimum Pensionable\nIncome. The Scheme, previously known as the Baptist Ministers' Pension\nFund, started in 1925, but was closed to future accrual of defined benefits\non 31 December 2011.\nA formal valuation of the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan was performed at\n31 December 2013 by a professionally qualified Actuary using the\nProjected Unit Method. The market value of the DB Plan assets at the\nvaluation date was E162 million.\nThis valuation of the DB Plan revealed a deficit of assets compared\nwith the value of liabilities of 684 million (equivalent to a past service\nfunding level of 660/0). The deficit is now much higher. As a result of the\nvaluation, in addition to the contributions to the DC Plan set out above, it\nwas agreed to increase the standard rate of deficiency contributions from\nchurches and other employers involved in the DB Plan from 11'/0 of\nPensionable Income/Minimum Pensionable Income to 120/0 from 1 January\n2016. The contributions are based on each church's or other employer's\nposition at March 2015. Some churches and other employers that were\nonly involved in the DB Plan for a short period now pay less than 12'/0.\nThe Recovery Plan envisages deficiency contributions continuing until 30\nJune 2035. The Church's individual estimated debt within the Baptist\nPension Scheme is E161,100, based on the service of current and previous\nministers.\nStructure, governance and management\nThe method of appointment of the Leadership Team is set out in the\nChurch Constitution. The Leadership Team consists of the Ministers, the\nElders, the Church Secretary, the Church Treasurer, and the Deacons who\nare elected by Church members. All those who attend our services or who\nare members of the congregation are encouraged to consider Church\nmembership in line with the Church's basis of faith and values.\nThe Church members at the Church Meeting are responsible for\nmaking decisions on all matters of general concern and importance to the\nChurch, including deciding on how the funds of the Church are to be\nspent. They are regularly asked to agree a recommendation brought by\nthe Leadership Team.\nThe Leadership Team met formally 12 times during the year with an\naverage attendance of 75'/0 (2015: 80'/0) and Church Meetings were held\non 4 occasions with an average attendance of 27'/0 (2016: 28'/0) of the\nmembership. Oversight of the numerous responsibilities and functions in\nthe Church (for example worship, discipleship, outreach) is carried out by\nindividual members of the Leadership Team who are responsible to the\nTeam and to the Church as a whole, and they report regularly on their\nactivities.\nThe Trustees believe they have complied with their duty to have due\nregard to the guidance on public benefit prescribed by the Charities\nCommission in exercising their powers and duties.\nAdministrative Information\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church is affiliated to the Eastern Baptist\nAssociation and to the Baptist Union. The correspondence address is The\n11\nBaptist Church Centre, Twyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, CM23 3U. Most\nmeetings are held at the Church Centre, but regular use is also made of\nthe Havers Community Centre in Waytemore Road, Bishop's Stortford.\nThe Church is registered with the Charities Commission as a Charitable\nIncorporated Organisation (number 1159484; Constitution last amended\n21"" September 2017).\nThe Leadership Team form the body of Trustees and for 2017 was as\nfollows:\nEx Officio Member\nSenior Minister\nElected Members:\nElders\nChurch Secretary\nChurch Treasurer\nDeacons\nThe Reverend John Walford\nMr Simon Curran\nMr Martin Gill\nMr Trevor McKenzie (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMr Robin Baker\nMr Geoffrey Gosling\nMr Keith Bintley (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMrs Judy Box\nMrs Janet Casson\nMrs Julia Horner\nMr Richard Jones\nDr Jonathan Kisenyi (resigned 23""' March 2017)\nMr Richard Lake (elected 23'4 March 2017)\nMrs Tracy Moreton\nMrs Wendy Shipperlee\nMr Peter Solway\nMrs Vicki Sweeney (resigned 12"" October 2017)\nMr Barry Tallintire\nMr Graham Vernon (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMr Mark Wheeler (resigned 23' March 2017)\nbishops stortford baptist church\n2017\nCHURCH ACCOUNTS\nFor Annual Church Meeting\n22' March 201S\nbtshops storttord tophet church\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nThis Church aims to be a community of believets Bving according to the Bible's teaching\nwhere people become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\n15'"" February 2018\nindependent Examiners' Report to the Trustees of\nBishop's Stoifford Baptist Church\nRespective Responsibilities of Trustees and Examiners\nWe report on the accounts of the church for the year ended 31""December 2017.\nThe church's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts. The church trustees\nconsider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the Charities Act 2011 (the\n2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is our responsibility to:\n~\nExamine the accounts under Section 145 of the 2011 Act;\n~\nTo follow the procedures laid down in the General Directions given by the Charity\nCommissioners under Section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\n~\nTo state whether particular matters have come to our attention.\nBasis of Independent Examiners' Report\nOur examination was carried out in accordance with the General Directions given by the Charities\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the church and a\ncomparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration of any\nunusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from the trustees concerning\nany such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the evidence that would be required\nin an audit and consequently no opinion is given as to whether the accounts present a ""true and fair\nview"" and the report is limited to those matters set out in the statement below.\nindependent Examiners' Statement\nSince the gross income for the year exceeds the amount provided in Section 145(3) of the Act, we\nconfirm that we are qualified to act as Independent examiners under the provisions of that section of\nthe Act and that Tenne Shorter's qualification is as shown below.\nIn connection with our examination, no matter has come to our attention:\n~\nWhich gives us reasonable cause to believe that in any material respect the requirements:\nto To keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of The Act; and\no To prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with the\naccounting requirements of the 2011 Act have not been met; or\n~\nTo which, in our opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper understanding\nof the accounts to be reached.\n( yt-c\nMr Michael Casson~\nMrs Tracey Crocker\n4, Pearse House\nHatchetts Cottage,\nBirchwood Mews\nBeggarmans Lane,\nBishop's Stortford,\nOld Hall Green,\nCM23 5FA\nNr Ware SG11 1HB\nMrs Tanne Shorler ACA\n206 Stansted Road\nBishop's Stortford\nCM23 2AR\nBaptist Church Centre\nK3: Twyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, CM23 3LJ\n't ': 01279 836695 t:ts churchofftceCastortfordbaptist. org\nt ft: www. stortfordbaptist. org\nRegistered Charity No. 1159484\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Financial Activities\nFor the period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nUnrestricted\nfunds\nRestricted\nEndowment\nfunds\nfunds\nTotal\nPrior year\nfunds\ntotal funds\nincome end endowments burnt\nDonations and legacies\nInvestments\nTotal income and endowments from:\nExpenditure on:\nExpenditure on charitable aciwities\nTotal expenditure on:\n341,023.40\n1,581.42\n342,604.82\n309,341.57\n309,341.57\n341,023 40 332,078 62\n1,581 42\n2, 162 65\n342, 604.82\n334,241.27\n309,341.57\n341,455 31\n309,341.57 341,455.31\nNet income I (expenditum)\n33,263.25\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\nTranafem\nGross trsnsfem between funds —in\nGross transfers between funds —out\nNet income I (expenditure)\nOcher recognised gains I losses\nGains I losses on investment assets\nGains on revaluation, gxed assets, chanty's own use\nNet movement in funds\nReconciliation of funds\nTotal funds brought forward\nTotal tunds carried forward\n72,491 68\n(72,491.68)\n33,263.25\n33,263.25\n458,754.21\n6,381.50\n492,017.46\n6,381.50\n123.00\n72,614.68\n94,570 71\n(123.00) (72,614.68) (94,570.71)\n33,283.25\n(7,214.04)\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\n465,135.71\n472, 349.75\n498,398.96 465,135.71\n24 January 2018 Page 1\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Recommended Practice\nFor the Period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nTotal Funds\nPrior Year Funds\nFixed assets\nTangible assets\n0.00\n0.00\nCurrent assets\nDebtors (Accounts Receivable)\nInvestments\nCash at bank/ in hand\nLiabilities\nCreditOrS: (Amounts falling\ndue after more than one year)\n77,461.26\n411,003.34\n9 934.36\n498 398.96\n0.00\n51,515.36\n390,183.94\n23 436.41\n465 135.11\n0.00\nNet current assets/(liabilities)\nTotal assets less current liabilities\nTotal net assets / (liabilities)\n498 398.96\n498 398.96\n498 398.96\n465 135.71\n465 135.71\n465 135.71\nThe funds of the charity\nEndowment\nRestricted\nDesignated\nUnrestricted income funds\nThe funds of the charity\n0.00\n6,381.50\n463,693.54\n28 323.92\n498 398.96\n0.00\n6,381.50\n458, 656.90\n97.31\n465 135.71\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nBalance Sheet detailed\nAs at\n31/1 2/2017\nAs at\n31/12/2016\nFixed assets\nOTHER: venous small fixed assets\nPASYSTEM: P A System for Worship\nTotal Fixed assets\nCurrent assets\nBU DEPOSIT: Baptist Union Dsposd Acc\nCA001: Bank Current Acc (Lloyds)\nCA003: Deposit Acc (Lloyds)\nCA005 Cash in Hand (Office)\nCA006: Cash in hand (Treasurer)\nCA013: Saffron BS Corp Tracker Bond\nCA014: Saffron BS Loyalty Corporate Account\nZ05: Accounts Receivable\nTotal Current assets\n310,594. 19\n9,663.71\n56,699.56\n101.42\n169.23\n38,032.23\n5,677.36\n77,461.26\n498,398.96\n309,395.72\n17,417.17\n43,088.94\n126.43\n226.78\n37,699.28\n5,666.03\n51,515.36\n465„135.71\nLiabilities\nZ04: Accounts Payable\nZ10: NCC Loan 5\nTotal Liabilities\nNet Asset surplus (deficit)\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nReserves\nExcess /(deficit) to date\nZ01.

The Church’s\nmission is to enable people to become fully devoted followers of Jesus\nChrist by the power of the Holy Spirit. To that end, we understand the\npurposes of the Church to be worship, discipleship, fellowship, outreach\nand service. The fellowship of the Church seeks to go deeper with God,\nbecome closer to each other and wider in our influence.\nObjectives and Overview\nThe Church is committed to carrying out its activities in line with the\nBaptist tradition and to encourage and enable people in the local area to\nattend and take part in its services and meetings. Activities include:\ne Services each week for worship, prayer, Bible study, preaching and\nteaching, including additional services for those in the local area\nwhose first language is not English\nBaptisms on request\nMeetings for young people\nSmall group meetings (LIFE Groups) for all ages\nPastoral care\nDiscipleship for Christian service\nEvangelism and mission\nSupport of Christian and social charitable action within the local\narea\ne Support for mission overseas\ne Involvement with the local and national Baptist associations\nThe ministry areas of the Church are classified into Worship,\nFellowship, Reaching Out, Discipleship and Social Action, supplemented by\na Resources Team (all led by the Deacons) and with spiritual oversight\nand pastoral care administered by the Elders.\nChurch Activities\nWorship, Teaching and Prayer\nOur Sunday morning service of worship continues to be the largest\nevent in the Church’s life and the point when the Church Community\ncomes together. In 2017 we began to see a growing number of people in\nmembership but fewer people attending on a weekly basis. This seems to\nreflect the pressures on people’s lives to spread themselves between\nmany different needs. Consequently the average number of weekly\nattenders was slightly lower but the total number of worshippers grew. As\nbefore a greater number are attending during the main festivals, with our\nnumbers peaking on Easter Day and for our Carol Service. In addition to\nour morning service we also have a smaller Sunday evening service and a\nSunday afternoon Portuguese language service. In 2017 in the mornings\nwe looked at:\n+  Cultivating a healthy soul\nBecoming Missionary Disciples\nActs 1-8\nMatthew 5-6\nRecovering the Image of God\nAn Advent series thinking of God'’s love coming to us\nIn the evenings we looked at:\nGalatians\nIsaiah\nJames\nAs previously, a committed team of worship leaders and the preaching\nteam are involved in leading services. Our Senior Minister took a time of\nsabbatical during which various guest speakers were involved. We once\nagain ran a series of ‘Deeper’ in the spring; offering a more interactive\napproach than a typical evening service, with in-depth teaching entitled:\n‘What good is the Law’ followed by small group discussion. On the second\nSunday evening of each month we have continued to run our informal\n‘Refresh’ service. During the year we also had the opportunity to hold\nservices for a local school and our local Mencap centre.\nVarious members of the congregation lead prayer in services and people\ncan also seek personal prayer after each service. We have a dedicated\nPrayer Room and prayers are held there weekdays at noon. Prayer is a\nvital component of our small group meetings during the week. Prayer\nBreakfasts have been held during the year with differing formats and\nstyles. These have been made family friendly so they provide a good\nopportunity for people of all ages to come and enjoy fellowship and pray\nin an informal setting.\nDiscipleship\nA new Deacon to head up Discipleship was appointed in March 2017,\nwith the aim of building a culture of discipleship in various forms. The\nChurch strategy is primarily to promote and develop small groups, which\nare designed to be an informal space where members can build\nrelationships, deepen faith and grow as disciples. During the year, these\ngroups were rebranded as LIFE Groups to better reflect their purpose\nwhich is to share the life that Jesus gives in a smaller setting. The\ngroup leaders met together twice in 2017 to encourage each other, share\nideas, discuss challenges, consider the future development of the\ngroups, and how to grow group attendance. A survey of non-attenders\nwas carried out in November. Encouragement to the congregation to\nattend groups continues to be given in morning services. A new group\nhas been established to nurture new Christians who have been through\nthe Alpha course that the Church runs. The group notice board and\nChurch web site have been also updated to reflect the changes.\nA new men's ministry is under consideration to enable informal\ncross-generational mentoring and spiritual growth. This is seen as\nparticularly valuable for the younger adults, but would benefit all\nthose involved through the building of relationships. Mutual\naccountability partnerships for men and women are also being promoted\nacross the wider Church.\nOrganisation of the Church library has progressed with the removal\nof dated or duplicated books. Modern study and reference books have\nbeen purchased which are for the use of LIFE group leaders and those\nwho may need resources for sermon preparation. The purchase of\nfurther books is planned, and the overhaul of group resources continues.\nRegular book promotions and the sale of books to make printed resources\nas accessible as possible are intended. Bible reading notes are also\navailable for children, young people and adults with the opportunity to\ntry out the notes before buying.\nInternational Ministry\nIn June, we celebrated our 10th Anniversary of the International\nMinistry and give thanks for God's faithfulness over the years.\nGustavo Gubiani has been appointed as International Ministry Leader,\nbut Tracy Moreton is still very much engaged and responsible for\ndeveloping Language Programmes and International Events. ‘Café and\nCompanhia’” has proved very successful with between 10 and 20 ladies\nattending. ‘International Café’ was launched in November, planned as a\nmonthly activity. Students from the language programme have attended\nboth events which provides an opportunity for bridge building. This year\nmost of the students are from the local community. Both initiatives are\nfocusing on reaching out.\nThe Portuguese speaking congregation has been experiencing a deeper\nknowledge of Christ, that is gradually being reflected in their walk with\neach other and society. The weekly Portuguese Service has an attendance\nof between 20-30 (adults and children) and has become well known by\nothers. Alongside the services, discipleship classes and pastoral care is\nbeing given. Marcela Gubiani assists in this ministry and helps with the\nladies (outreach and care) and teaching of the children. A Portuguese LIFE\ngroup has started once a week, as another way to connect with people\noutside the Church building, enabling the group to pray together, support\neach other and use their gifts.\nThe International Ministry continues with the vision to draw people in\nfrom the wider town community and is very effective in aiding the\nInternational Community to feel fully included in the Church family.\nSocial Action\nOur focus is to engage with our local community and make a difference\nthrough our four aims:\n- Supporting those in need, particularly the poorer in society and\nthose struggling financially.\n- Supporting community groups who meet specific needs in our local\narea.\n- Caring for the local environment.\n- Fellowship.\nA wide variety of social action projects have been ongoing throughout\nthe year, including the Bishops Stortford Money Advice Service. However,\nhighlights and changes during 2017 were:\nExchange - we have been working mainly with the local Children’s\nCentre this year and have been able to help two people with furniture\nstorage after they had been made homeless.\nBishops Stortford Food Bank - a new co-ordinator has been appointed\nand will be increasing the opening times from 3 days to 4 in February\n2018.\nToddlers - Remains very popular, and many of the Toddlers families\nhave also attended Messy Church.\nYMCA - is now part of YMCA East Herts, so the manager has moved on\nand a new management team is in place.\nStreet Pastors - Has a new co-ordinator and has teams going out most\nFriday evenings.\nGrove Cottage - We are hoping that the Puppets Galore team will be\nable to run some sessions at Grove Cottage, and we may be able to help\nthe Grove Cottage Life Skills Coach to find useful work experience for their\nmembers.\nCanal Adoption - Our Waterways Chaplain has now moved away to\nNewbury to minister on the waterways there, but we are still working with\nthe Canal & River Trust to maintain and improve the canal by the Church.\nReaching Out\nOverview\nWe continue to seek to weave the thread of evangelism through all\nour Church ministry areas and activities, to draw people closer to God and\ngive the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Him. Our Church\nbuilding, our Services, our welcome and fellowship, should all reflect\nChrist’s Love. We also look to extend a wider influence in the local\ncommunity, as we try to draw a diverse selection of people into our\npremises, and as we also hold a variety of events at different venues\naround the area.\nLocal Work\nWe ran an Alpha course again this year with one guest, who has gone on\nto be baptised, become a Church member and join one of our LIFE\nGroups.\nFitness - Circuit Training classes for both sexes are running on Monday\nevenings with a core class of 12. Approximately half the class do not\nattend the Church, although some of them are friends of Church\nmembers.\nFlower Arranging continues as an occasional course with The Lonely\nBouquet Scheme now established as a successful spin-off, by putting\nany left-over blooms to good use. This year, other churches in the town\n4\nwere invited to join together over Easter, to cover our community with\nLonely Bouquets. In spite of relatively short notice, two other churches\ntook part, and we hope to build on this in the future.\nMessy Church. We had two successful events this year, at Easter and\nHalloween. Over 100 people attended both, which were much enjoyed.\nThis year included the ever-popular puppets, as well as flower arranging\nand also two new activities, a 'Bake Off' and 'Lego Master Builder'; both\nproved very successful. Many of those who attended would not normally\ncome along to a church service.\nTable Tennis - this continues as a youth event with participating\nnumbers, but not enthusiasm, gradually dropping over the year. The\nintroduction of a short Biblical talk in the half-time break, has now become\nestablished and provokes more discussion and participation.\nWorld Mission\nSome while ago, the Church committed 10% of a large legacy that it\nreceived to overseas mission work, and specifically for work in Rwanda.\nWe have now agreed a partnership with Tearfund for Church Led\nCommunity Transformation in the Vivante Huye Local Church and\nTumba Community in Rwanda. This is a three-year project and\nmeasures have been agreed for this to be closely monitored with quarterly\nreports from Tearfund on progress, visits from Tearfund speakers to\nprovide updates and visits to the project by Church members.\nFor Mission Sunday, in May, we had the honour to have David Kerrigan,\nthe retiring Leader of BMS World Mission come and speak to us about\ntheir newly published Mission Development Programme, set to achieve its\nintended ambitious goals by 2020. We were complemented on our faithful\nfinancial support for BMS, where we fall into the top 10% of contributing\nchurches.\nWe continue to support Roland & Carolien Smith and their work with\nEuropean Christian Mission in the Netherlands, Eric and Claire\nSingirankabo in Rwanda and Lizzie and Paul Reed seeking to continue\ntheir work in Russia. We have links with Kate & Storly Michel\nministering to Haiti.\nWe have also adopted BMS missionaries Sergio and Liz Vilela, working\nwith youth and children in Mozambique. We support them through our\ncontribution to BMS World Mission and also get regular prayer updates\nand access to their blogs via our website. Previously they were both youth\npastors at Saffron Waldon Baptist Church and Liz also worked with Stort\nValley Schools Trust, to which we are closely connected.\nOur family Harvest Service related to BMS World Mission this year too,\nwhere we highlighted the work being done in Thailand with severely\ndisabled children who cannot be cared for by their families. Titled\n‘Wonderfully Made’ and portraying the children as ‘Super Heroes’, our\nSunday Club classes really got behind the theme, and with the help of\ntheir leaders, contributed much to the success of the service. We were\nvery much encouraged by the efforts of one little girl, who later went on\nto organise a cake sale to raise funds for this cause too.\nFellowship (2017)\nOverview\nIt has been very encouraging over the past year to see how the fellowship\nof believers at the Church is deepening its commitment to each other and\nto the wider community.\nThe new ‘Friends Together’ initiative on the second and fourth Friday of\nevery month at Caffe Nero is meeting a need for informal fellowship and\nan opportunity to bring other friends along. There is a core group of\npeople from the Church who are committed to supporting it. Besides\nregular attenders, over the months many people have popped in and\nspent time over tea or coffee, broadening friendships and getting to know\nmore about each other, understanding needs and giving support.\nIt is hoped that the planned Café at the Church ‘Breaking Bread’ on a\nTuesday afternoon will fulfil a similar need, as well as providing a safe\nplace to enjoy fellowship with each other and the local community. The\nnew furniture in the Gathering Area is intended to make the environment\nmore welcoming and purposeful. New noticeboards have been installed to\ngive information on the different areas of the Church’s work and a new\ndisplay counter with leaflets advertising and promoting what we do is soon\nto be installed.\nAn extended welcome team are set to begin an approach whereby\nnewcomers can enjoy a welcoming fellowship lunch, together with existing\nmembers and worshippers who have a heart for hospitality.\nThe Baptist Women's Link (BWL) continues to thrive with ladies (and\nsome gentlemen) enjoying fellowship. The members enjoy varied talks\nand activities, lifts are organised, special occasions (such as the Christmas\ncard sale, lunches and teas) are catered for, and members are visited at\nother times of the week - all a regular feature of this group. Our\ncommitted leader over several years, Sheila Vernon, is stepping down in\nApril 2018 and a new leader is needed for September 2018 onwards.\nThe Contact Group continues to provide valuable fellowship to our folk\nwho are elderly and unable to get out of their homes. Together with BWL\nthey had a very enjoyable Summer outing to The Gardens of Easton\nLodge in July which was only made possible due to our volunteer mini-bus\ndrivers and the ladies who prepared a delicious tea at the Church. This\ntruly reflects the quality of our fellowship here, that so many people are\nprepared to give of their time to facilitate a welcome treat for these\npeople.\nChildren and Youth (2017)\nThe children and youth work continued positively with a fantastic team\nof committed leaders. On a Sunday morning we have regular contact with\nabout 100 children and young people (mainly children with parents in\nChurch), where we learn about God’s word for us, how we get to know\nhim, and how we can follow his will for our lives. During the week we\ncontinued with the various youth clubs where we see many other young\npeople from the local area come to get to know us and hear something of\nhow God loves them.\nOne or two activities, such as GROW and the parent workshops,\nstopped during the year where we felt they had run their course or where\nwe used our resources elsewhere. However we had the joy of seeing\nYouth Church start where, once or twice a term, alongside the main\nmorning service there is a separate service for the young people to come\ntogether for worship, learning, discussion and prayer. Seeing some of the\nyoung people from Zone (the Friday evening club) come along to this has\nbeen tremendous.\nAlso this year Heather Martin and Beth Walford have started a\nDiscipleship Group for the older girls, who share a meal together with time\nand space to relax, chat, ask questions and provide support for one\n6\nanother.\nWe await the appointment of a new Associate Minister who will have\noversight of the work. In the meantime special mention should once again\nbe made of Heather for her enthusiasm and commitment to the young\npeople and to Jo Moore for her skillful organisation of, and unwavering\nsupport to, the volunteer leaders. This includes ensuring the Safeguarding\nPolicy is kept up to date, rigorously adhered to and training provided, to\nensure the safety of our children and leaders.\nFuture Plans\nA number of aims have been identified for developing the Church and\nits work in 2018:\ne Continuing to build a Purpose Driven Church and grow people in\nChristian life and service as missionary disciples.\ne The appointment of an Associate Minster to strengthen our ministry\nteam, provide oversight of our youth work and assist with the many\ninitiatives that are developing\ne Phase 2 of the development of the Church site. We intend to agree\nthe vision and outline concept before moving forward to obtaining\ndrawings and plans for a new second building on the site This is a\nlong-term project and teams of people will be formed to take this\nforward.\ne LIFE Group attendance. This has fallen over the past few years and\nattempts will be made to get much greater involvement.\ne Hallingbury Free Church. The Church administers this chapel and\nmanse in a local village. The work is dormant and a decision will be\nmade about its future.\nExternal Links\nThe Church continues to be linked in fellowship to the national\nstructures of the Baptist Union of Great Britain which are expressed locally\nthrough the Eastern Baptist Association.\nThe Church also remains a member of Churches Together in Bishop’s\nStortford, the Evangelical Alliance and the Willow Creek Association.\nChurch members take part in the meetings and events of Churches\nTogether and support a number of joint projects. These include Holiday\nBible Week, Street Pastors and ‘Thirst’ Youth Café. Churches also meet\ntogether for a service on Good Friday and for prayer at various times.\nPremises\nWe continue to have a significant property holding and liability which is\nmanaged by a small group of volunteers. The budgetary requirement\ncontinues to be under scrutiny, as we are now starting to see\nelements of the Church Centre where we need to start to consider\nreplacement. To keep to overall budgetary constraints however, we have\nnot yet been making regular provision for such end of life replacements,\nbut we have managed single allocations to these reserves from end-of-\nyear surpluses, so far totalling £10,000.\nThe Church Centre\nSome design proposals have been made to provide safe access to the\nroof as we need to make easier arrangements for clearing of gutters etc.\nin the future. We hope to finalise this in 2018.\nSome paving has been laid in a small grass area at the side of the\nChurch Centre, mainly replacing some dead turfs, so that better use can\nbe made of this space.\nA team of dedicated gardeners continue to maintain the grounds, for\nwhich we are very grateful.\nThere have been numerous minor maintenance issues throughout the\nyear, some needing to call on specific talents or employing specialist\ncompanies.\nWe ask Church attendees to advise of any issues that they become\naware of that need attention, so that we can keep the buildings up to a\nhigh standard. We also like to know of any individuals with gifting relating\nto buildings; God has already provided for our needs, but he does call\neach one of us to offer those gifts back to him.\nThe second building on the site\nThe small offices in the left of this building are being used to some\ndegree to house the language classes and ‘Exchange’. The\nremainder of the block remains un-useable due to a lack of safe power\nsupply, lighting or heating which would need considerable investment and\nawaits the development of the finalisation of the vision for this area.\nThe Church Manse\nThere have been some minor issues which needed to be resolved,\nparticularly with regard to the shower and some flooring problems. In the\nnear future we may need to consider updating the bathrooms.\nChurch Membership\nThere has been appreciable growth in membership during the year.\nThe year started with 227 members and ended with 235. We have been\nencouraged by 14 applications for membership whilst only 6 have left; 1\nthrough death, 1 because of infirmity and the remaining 4 have left the\narea.\nWe have been further encouraged by 11 requests for baptism during\nthe year, 7 of whom came into membership and a further 2 have asked\nand we expect them to become members shortly. Of the remainder 1 has\nleft the area temporarily to undergo training.\nWorthy of particular note is that the age profile of Church members\nhas dropped significantly. In recent years the normal distribution has been\ncentred on the 50-60 age group but as the graph below shows this is now\non the 40-50 group.\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nMembership by Age as at December 2017\n10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80-89 90+  \n‘Discover BSBC’ groups have again been held for newcomers to the\nChurch to find out more about its beliefs, practices, priorities and\nactivities. These are informal and interactive sessions during which people\ncan also learn the importance of membership within Baptist churches,\nwhere governance is the responsibility of the gathered membership. On\ncompletion of the 3 sessions attendees can decide whether they wish to\napply to become members of the Church. Three ‘Discover BSBC' groups\nwere held in May, June and November with a total of 14 attendees.\nStaff and Volunteers\nWe are extremely grateful to the paid staff team who look after the\nChurch Centre and its multitude of activities for the church and\ncommunity each day: John Walford (Senior Minister), Tim Kingston\nHepner (Church Centre Manager), Jo Moore (Personal Assistant to the\nMinisters), Liz Lake (Church Publicist). We hope to appoint an Associate\nMinister in 2018.\nBut nothing would happen effectively either without the enormous\nteam of volunteers that serve so faithfully in a committed and enthusiastic\nfashion. So many of our members are involved in one way or another.\nAdditionally we pay tribute to the Trustees who have stood down in\n2017 either at the end of their term of office or because of personal\ncircumstances or commitments elsewhere: Keith Bintley, Jonathan\nKisenyi, Trevor McKenzie, Vicki Sweeney, Graham Vernon, Mark Wheeler.\nFinancial Overview\nAll monies received are donations from members and other persons\nassociated with the Church. A small sum is received from the hiring of\npremises to other organisations.\nOverall, planned giving through envelopes and weekly offerings\n(including casual cash gifts) showed an increase compared with the\nprevious year, whereas direct giving by Standing Order decreased.\nOrganisations using the Church Centre for various functions led to\n£11,329 in fees being received.\nTotal receipts for the General Fund (including Gift Aid) were £342,605,\nan increase over the equivalent giving in 2016 (£334,241).\nA total of £75,222 was given to Mission, to similar ministries to 2016.\nOnce Gift Aid had been claimed for the entire year, there was an excess of\nreceipts over payments for the year of £28,323.92\n£2,675 was spent on such items as additional furniture for the\nGathering Area, signage, shelving and other equipment. £60,000 was\nmade towards repayment of the Baptist Union Corporation loan for the\nChurch Centre construction cost, so that the amount outstanding is now\n£411,093.70. The loan is to be paid back over a period of 15 years, by\n2026.\nThe September Church Meeting decided to commit to financial and\nprayerful support for Tearfund’s Church Led Community Transformation\nProject in Vivante Huye Local Church and Tumba Community in Rwanda.\nThe financial commitment is to contribute £27,763 each November (from\n2017 -2019) from our Special Gifts Fund. This Fund will need a further\n£21,791.32 to be added in order to be able to fully meet this commitment.\nAs at 31st December 2017 the General Reserve stood at £144,140.\nThe Capital Goods Reserve stood at £20,183. The monies held for the\nChurch Centre, Special Projects and gifts towards purchasing the\nremainder of the site (including the remainder of funds held following the\nsale of 37 Hurn Grove in 2015) totalled £180,253.\nThe Church has a Reserves Policy and a minimum sum is stipulated\nwithin this and held within the General Reserve. The amount is sufficient\nfor meeting obligations in a three-month period should the Church have to\nbe wound up.\nWorkplace Pensions — Automatic Enrolment\nThe Church is an employer participating in a pension scheme known as\nthe Baptist Ministers' Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”). The Scheme is a\nseparate legal entity which is administered by the Pension Trustee (Baptist\nPension Trust Limited). This satisfies our legal requirement for pension\nprovision for our employees.\nThe Minister and all members of the church staff are eligible to join the\nScheme, which is not contracted out of the State Second Pension.\nFrom January 2012, pension provision is being made through the Defined\nContribution (DC) Plan within the Scheme. In general, members of the\nMinisters’ section of the scheme pay 8% of their Pensionable Income and\nemployers pay 6% of members’ Pensionable Income into individual\npension accounts, which are operated and managed on behalf of the\nPension Trustee by Legal and General Life Assurance Society Limited. In\naddition, the employer pays a further 4% of Pensionable Income (or 3% if\nthe employer is in the segregated DC section) to cover Death in Service\nBenefits, administration costs, and an associated insurance policy which\nprovides income protection for Scheme members in the event that they\nare unable to work due to long-term incapacity. This income protection\npolicy has been insured by the Baptist Union of Great Britain with Unum\nLimited.\nOur non-ministerial employees are eligible to join the Basic section of\nthe scheme. Members of the Basic Section pay contributions of 5% of\nPensionable Income, and their employers also pay a total of 5%.\nBenefits in respect of service prior to 1 January 2012 are provided\nthrough the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan within the Scheme. The main\nbenefits for pre-2012 service were a defined benefit pension of one\neightieth of Final Minimum Pensionable Income for each year of\n10\nPensionable Service, together with additional pension in respect of\npremiums paid on Pensionable Income in excess of Minimum Pensionable\nIncome. The Scheme, previously known as the Baptist Ministers’ Pension\nFund, started in 1925, but was closed to future accrual of defined benefits\non 31 December 2011.\nA formal valuation of the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan was performed at\n31 December 2013 by a professionally qualified Actuary using the\nProjected Unit Method. The market value of the DB Plan assets at the\nvaluation date was £162 million.\nThis valuation of the DB Plan revealed a deficit of assets compared\nwith the value of liabilities of £84 million (equivalent to a past service\nfunding level of 66%). The deficit is now much higher. As a result of the\nvaluation, in addition to the contributions to the DC Plan set out above, it\nwas agreed to increase the standard rate of deficiency contributions from\nchurches and other employers involved in the DB Plan from 11% of\nPensionable Income/Minimum Pensionable Income to 12% from 1 January\n2016. The contributions are based on each church’s or other employer’s\nposition at March 2015. Some churches and other employers that were\nonly involved in the DB Plan for a short period now pay less than 12%.\nThe Recovery Plan envisages deficiency contributions continuing until 30\nJune 2035. The Church’s individual estimated debt within the Baptist\nPension Scheme is £161,100, based on the service of current and previous\nministers.\nStructure, governance and management\nThe method of appointment of the Leadership Team is set out in the\nChurch Constitution. The Leadership Team consists of the Ministers, the\nElders, the Church Secretary, the Church Treasurer, and the Deacons who\nare elected by Church members. All those who attend our services or who\nare members of the congregation are encouraged to consider Church\nmembership in line with the Church’s basis of faith and values.\nThe Church members at the Church Meeting are responsible for\nmaking decisions on all matters of general concern and importance to the\nChurch, including deciding on how the funds of the Church are to be\nspent. They are regularly asked to agree a recommendation brought by\nthe Leadership Team.\nThe Leadership Team met formally 12 times during the year with an\naverage attendance of 75% (2015: 80%) and Church Meetings were held\non 4 occasions with an average attendance of 27% (2016: 28%) of the\nmembership. Oversight of the numerous responsibilities and functions in\nthe Church (for example worship, discipleship, outreach) is carried out by\nindividual members of the Leadership Team who are responsible to the\nTeam and to the Church as a whole, and they report regularly on their\nactivities.\nThe Trustees believe they have complied with their duty to have due\nregard to the guidance on public benefit prescribed by the Charities\nCommission in exercising their powers and duties.\nAdministrative Information\nBishop’s Stortford Baptist Church is affiliated to the Eastern Baptist\nAssociation and to the Baptist Union. The correspondence address is The\n11\nBaptist Church Centre, Twyford Road, Bishop’s Stortford, CM23 3L]J. Most meetings are held at the Church Centre, but regular use is also made of the Havers Community Centre in Waytemore Road, Bishop’s Stortford. The Church is registered with the Charities Commission as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (number 1159484; Constitution last amended 215t September 2017).

The church trustees\nconsider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the Charities Act 2011 (the\n2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is our responsibility to:\ne Examine the accounts under Section 145 of the 2011 Act;\no To follow the procedures laid down in the General Directions given by the Charity\nCommissioners under Section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\ne To state whether particular matters have come to our attention.\nBasis of Independent Examiners’ Report\nOur examination was carried out in accordance with the General Directions given by the Charities\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the church and a\ncomparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration of any\nunusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from the trustees concerning\nany such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the evidence that would be required\nin an audit and consequently no opinion is given as to whether the accounts present a “true and fair\nview” and the report is limited to those matters set out in the statement below.\nIndependent Examiners’ Statement\nSince the gross income for the year exceeds the amount provided in Section 145(3) of the Act, we\nconfirm that we are qualified to act as Independent examiners under the provisions of that section of\nthe Act and that Tanne Shorter’s qualification is as shown below.\nIn connection with our examination, no matter has come to our attention:\ne Which gives us reasonable cause to believe that in any material respect the requirements:\no To keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of The Act; and\no To prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with the\naccounting requirements of the 2011 Act have not been met; or\ne To which, in our opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper understanding\nof the accounts to be reached.\nuk‘eva .,MQ,N’('A Creree S~ %\nMr Michael Casson”__) Mrs Tracey Crocker Mrs Tanne Shorier ACA\n4, Pearse House Hatchetts Cottage, 206 Stansted Road\nBirchwood Mews Beggarmans Lane, Bishop's Stortford\nBishop’s Stortford, Old Hall Green, CM23 2AR\nCM23 5FA Nr Ware SG11 1HB\n \n \nBaptist Church Centre\n&4: Twyford Road, Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, CM23 3LJ\n. 01279 836695 2: churchoffice@stortfordbaptist.org\n®: www.stortfordbaptist.org\nRegistered Charity No. 1159484\n \nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Financial Activities\nFor the period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nUnrestricted Restricted Endowment Total Prior year\nfunds funds funds funds total funds\nIncome and endowments from:\nDonations and legacies 341,023.40 — — 341,023.40 332,078.62\nInvestments 1,581.42 -

The Church's\nmission is to enable people to become fully devoted followers of Jesus\nChrist by the power of the Holy Spirit. To that end, we understand the\npurposes of the Church to be worship, discipleship, fellowship, outreach\nand service. The fellowship of the Church seeks to go deeper with God,\nbecome closer to each other and wider in our influence.\nObjectives and Overview\nThe Church is committed to carrying out its activities in line with the\nBaptist tradition and to encourage and enable people in the local area to\nattend and take part in its services and meetings. Activities include:\nServices each week for worship, prayer, Bible study, preaching and\nteaching, including additional services for those in the local area\nwhose first language is not English\nBaptisms on request\nMeetings for young people\nSmall group meetings (LIFE Groups) for all ages\nPastoral care\nDiscipleship for Christian service\nEvangelism and mission\nSupport of Christian and social charitable action within the local\narea\nSupport for mission overseas\nInvolvement with the local and national Baptist associations\nThe ministry areas of the Church are classified into Worship,\nFellowship, Reaching Out, Discipleship and Social Action, supplemented by\na Resources Team (all led by the Deacons) and with spiritual oversight\nand pastoral care administered by the Elders.\n1\nChurch Activities\nWorship, Teaching and Prayer\nOur Sunday morning service of worship continues to be the largest\nevent in the Church's life and the point when the Church Community\ncomes together. In 2017 we began to see a growing number of people in\nmembership but fewer people attending on a weekly basis. This seems to\nreflect the pressures on people's lives to spread themselves between\nmany different needs. Consequently the average number of weekly\nattenders was slightly lower but the total number of worshippers grew. As\nbefore a greater number are attending during the main festivals, with our\nnumbers peaking on Easter Day and for our Carol Service. In addition to\nour morning service we also have a smaller Sunday evening service and a\nSunday afternoon Portuguese language service. In 2017 in the mornings\nwe looked at:\nCultivating a healthy soul\nBecoming Missionary Disciples\nActs 1-8\nMatthew 5-6\nRecovering the Image of God\nAn Advent series thinking of God's love coming to us\nIn the evenings we looked at:\nGalatians\nIsaiah\nJames\nAs previously, a committed team of worship leaders and the preaching\nteam are involved in leading services. Our Senior Minister took a time of\nsabbatical during which various guest speakers were involved. We once\nagain ran a series of 'Deeper' in the spring; offering a more interactive\napproach than a typical evening service, with in-depth teaching entitled:\n'What good is the Law' followed by small group discussion. On the second\nSunday evening of each month we have continued to run our informal\n'Refresh service. During the year we also had the opportunity to hold\nservices for a local school and our local Mencap centre.\nVarious members of the congregation lead prayer in services and people\ncan also seek persona prayer after each service. We have a dedicated\nPrayer Room and prayers are held there weekdays at noon. Prayer is a\nvital component of our small group meetings during the week. Prayer\nBreakfasts have been held during the year with differing formats and\nstyles. These have been made family friendly SO they provide a good\nopportunity for people of all ages to come and enjoy fellowship and pray\nin an informal setting.\nDiscipleship\nA new Deacon to head up Discipleship was appointed in March 2017,\nwith the aim of building a culture of discipleship in various forms. The\nChurch strategy is primarily to promote and develop small groups, which\nare designed to be an informal space where members can build\nrelationships, deepen faith and grow as disciples. During the year, these\ngroups were rebranded as LIFE Groups to better reflect their purpose\nwhich is to share the life that Jesus gives in a smaller setting. The\ngroup leaders met together twice in 2017 to encourage each other, share\n2\nideas, discuss challenges, consider the future development of the\ngroups, and how to grow group attendance. A survey of non-attenders\nwas carried out in November. Encouragement to the congregation to\nattend groups continues to be given in morning services. A new group\nhas been established to nurture new Christians who have been through\nthe Alpha course that the Church runs. The group notice board and\nChurch web site have been also updated to reflect the changes.\nA new men's ministry is under consideration to enable informal\ncross-generational mentoring and spiritual growth. This is seen as\nparticularly valuable for the younger adults, but would benefit all\nthose involved through the building of relationships. Mutual\naccountability partnerships for men and women are also being promoted\nacross the wider Church.\nOrganisation of the Church library has progressed with the removal\nof dated or duplicated books. Modern study and reference books have\nbeen purchased which are for the use of LIFE group leaders and those\nwho may need resources for sermon preparation. The purchase of\nfurther books is planned, and the overhaul of group resources continues.\nRegular book promotions and the sale of books to make printed resources\nas accessible as possible are intended. Bible reading notes are also\navailable for children, young people and adults with the opportunity to\ntry out the notes before buying.\nInternational Ministry\nIn June, we celebrated our 10th Anniversary of the International\nMinistry and give thanks for God's faithfulness over the years.\nGustavo Gubiani has been appointed as International Ministry Leader,\nbut Tracy Moreton is still very much engaged and responsible for\ndeveloping Language Programmes and International Events. 'Cafe and\nCompanhia' has proved very successful with between 10 and 20 ladies\nattending. 'International Cafe' was launched in November, planned as a\nmonthly activity. Students from the language programme have attended\nboth events which provides an opportunity for bridge building. This year\nmost of the students are from the local community. Both initiatives are\nfocusing on reaching out.\nThe Portuguese speaking congregation has been experiencing a deeper\nknowledge of Christ, that is gradually being reflected in their walk with\neach other and society. The weekly Portuguese Service has an attendance\nof between 20-30 (adults and children) and has become well known by\nothers. Alongside the services, discipleship classes and pastoral care is\nbeing given. Marcela Gubiani assists in this ministry and helps with the\nladies (outreach and care) and teaching of the children. A Portuguese LIFE\ngroup has started once a week, as another way to connect with people\noutside the Church building, enabling the group to pray together, support\neach other and use their gifts.\nThe International Ministry continues with the vision to draw people in\nfrom the wider town community and is very effective in aiding the\nInternational Community to feel fully included in the Church family.\n3\nSocial Action\nOur focus is to engage with our local community and make a difference\nthrough our four aims:\n-\nSupporting those in need, particularly the poorer in society and\nthose struggling financially.\n-\nSupporting community groups who meet specific needs in our local\narea.\n- Caring for the local environment.\n- Fellowship.\nA wide variety of social action projects have been ongoing throughout\nthe year, including the Bishops Stortford Money Advice Service. However,\nhighlights and changes during 2017 were:\nExchange - we have been working mainly with the local Children's\nCentre this year and have been able to help two people with furniture\nstorage after they had been made homeless.\nBishops Stortford Food Bank - a new co-ordinator has been appointed\nand will be increasing the opening times from 3 days to 4 in February\n2018.\nToddlers - Remains very popular, and many of the Toddlers families\nhave also attended Messy Church.\nYMCA - is now part of YMCA East Herts, SO the manager has moved on\nand a new management team is in place.\nStreet Pastors - Has a new co-ordinator and has teams going out most\nFriday evenings.\nGrove Cottage - We are hoping that the Puppets Galore team will be\nable to run some sessions at Grove Cottage, and we may be able to help\nthe Grove Cottage Life Skills Coach to find useful work experience for their\nmembers.\nCanal Adoption - Our Waterways Chaplain has now moved away to\nNewbury to minister on the waterways there, but we are still working with\nthe Canal & River Trust to maintain and improve the canal by the Church.\nReaching Out\nOverview\nWe continue to seek to weave the thread of evangelism through all\nour Church ministry areas and activities, to draw people closer to God and\ngive the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Him. Our Church\nbuilding, our Services, our welcome and fellowship, should all reflect\nChrist's Love. We also look to extend a wider influence in the local\ncommunity, as we try to draw a diverse selection of people into our\npremises, and as we also hold a variety of events at different venues\naround the area.\nLocal Work\nWe ran an Alpha course again this year with one guest, who has gone on\nto be baptised, become a Church member and join one of our LIFE\nGroups.\nFitness - Circuit Training classes for both sexes are running on Monday\nevenings with a core class of 12. Approximately half the class do not\nattend the Church, although some of them are friends of Church\nmembers.\nFlower Arranging continues as an occasional course with The Lonely\nBouquet Scheme now established as a successful spin-off, by putting\nany left-over blooms to good use. This year, other churches in the town\n4\nwere invited to join together over Easter, to cover our community with\nLonely Bouquets. In spite of relatively short notice, two other churches\ntook part, and we hope to build on this in the future.\nMessy Church. We had two successful events this year, at Easter and\nHalloween. Over 100 people attended both, which were much enjoyed.\nThis year included the ever-popular puppets, as well as flower arranging\nand also two new activities, a 'Bake Off' and 'Lego Master Builder'; both\nproved very successful. Many of those who attended would not normally\ncome along to a church service.\nTable Tennis - this continues as a youth event with participating\nnumbers, but not enthusiasm, gradually dropping over the year. The\nintroduction of a short Biblical talk in the half-time break, has now become\nestablished and provokes more discussion and participation.\nWorld Mission\nSome while ago, the Church committed 10% of a large legacy that it\nreceived to overseas mission work, and specifically for work in Rwanda.\nWe have now agreed a partnership with Tearfund for Church Led\nCommunity Transformation in the Vivante Huye Local Church and\nTumba Community in Rwanda. This is a three-year project and\nmeasures have been agreed for this to be closely monitored with quarterly\nreports from Tearfund on progress, visits from Tearfund speakers to\nprovide updates and visits to the project by Church members.\nFor Mission Sunday, in May, we had the honour to have David Kerrigan,\nthe retiring Leader of BMS World Mission come and speak to us about\ntheir newly published Mission Development Programme, set to achieve its\nintended ambitious goals by 2020. We were complemented on our faithful\nfinancial support for BMS, where we fall into the top 10% of contributing\nchurches.\nWe continue to support Roland & Carolien Smith and their work with\nEuropean Christian Mission in the Netherlands, Eric and Claire\nSingirankabo in Rwanda and Lizzie and Paul Reed seeking to continue\ntheir work in Russia. We have links with Kate & Storly Michel\nministering to Haiti.\nWe have also adopted BMS missionaries Sergio and Liz Vilela, working\nwith youth and children in Mozambique. We support them through our\ncontribution to BMS World Mission and also get regular prayer updates\nand access to their blogs via our website. Previously they were both youth\npastors at Saffron Waldon Baptist Church and Liz also worked with Stort\nValley Schools Trust, to which we are closely connected.\nOur family Harvest Service related to BMS World Mission this year too,\nwhere we highlighted the work being done in Thailand with severely\ndisabled children who cannot be cared for by their families. Titled\n'Wonderfully Made' and portraying the children as 'Super Heroes', our\nSunday Club classes really got behind the theme, and with the help of\ntheir leaders, contributed much to the success of the service. We were\nvery much encouraged by the efforts of one little girI, who later went on\nto organise a cake sale to raise funds for this cause too.\nFellowship (2017)\nOverview\nIt has been very encouraging over the past year to see how the fellowship\nof believers at the Church is deepening its commitment to each other and\nto the wider community.\n5\nThe new 'Friends Together' initiative on the second and fourth Friday of\nevery month at Caffe Nero is meeting a need for informal fellowship and\nan opportunity to bring other friends along. There is a core group of\npeople from the Church who are committed to supporting it. Besides\nregular attenders, over the months many people have popped in and\nspent time over tea or coffee, broadening friendships and getting to know\nmore about each other, understanding needs and giving support.\nIt is hoped that the planned Cafe at the Church 'Breaking Bread' on\na\nTuesday afternoon will fulfil a similar need, as well as providing a safe\nplace to enjoy fellowship with each other and the local community. The\nnew furniture in the Gathering Area is intended to make the environment\nmore welcoming and purposeful. New noticeboards have been installed to\ngive information on the different areas of the Church's work and a new\ndisplay counter with leaflets advertising and promoting what we do is soon\nto be installed.\nAn extended welcome team are set to begin an approach whereby\nnewcomers can enjoy a welcoming fellowship lunch, together with existing\nmembers and worshippers who have a heart for hospitality.\nThe Baptist Women's Link (BWL) continues to thrive with ladies (and\nsome gentlemen) enjoying fellowship. The members enjoy varied talks\nand activities, lifts are organised, special occasions (such as the Christmas\ncard sale, lunches and teas) are catered for, and members are visited at\nother times of the week - all a regular feature of this group. Our\ncommitted leader over several years, Sheila Vernon, is stepping down in\nApril 2018 and a new leader is needed for September 2018 onwards.\nThe Contact Group continues to provide valuable fellowship to our folk\nwho are elderly and unable to get out of their homes. Together with BWL\nthey had a very enjoyable Summer outing to The Gardens of Easton\nLodge in July which was only made possible due to our volunteer mini-bus\ndrivers and the ladies who prepared a delicious tea at the Church. This\ntruly reflects the quality of our fellowship here, that SO many people are\nprepared to give of their time to facilitate a welcome treat for these\npeople.\nChildren and Youth (2017)\nThe children and youth work continued positively with a fantastic team\nof committed leaders. On a Sunday morning we have regular contact with\nabout 100 children and young people (mainly children with parents in\nChurch), where we learn about God's word for us, how we get to know\nhim, and how we can follow his will for our lives. During the week we\ncontinued with the various youth clubs where we see many other young\npeople from the local area come to get to know us and hear something of\nhow God loves them.\nOne or two activities, such as GROW and the parent workshops,\nstopped during the year where we felt they had run their course or where\nwe used our resources elsewhere. However we had the joy of seeing\nYouth Church start where, once or twice a term, alongside the main\nmorning service there is a separate service for the young people to come\ntogether for worship, learning, discussion and prayer. Seeing some of the\nyoung people from Zone (the Friday evening club) come along to this has\nbeen tremendous.\nAlso this year Heather Martin and Beth Walford have started a\nDiscipleship Group for the older girls, who share a meal together with time\nand space to relax, chat, ask questions and provide support for one\n6\nanother.\nWe await the appointment of a new Associate Minister who will have\noversight of the work. In the meantime special mention should once again\nbe made of Heather for her enthusiasm and commitment to the young\npeople and to Jo Moore for her skillful organisation of, and unwavering\nsupport to, the volunteer leaders. This includes ensuring the Safeguarding\nPolicy is kept up to date, rigorously adhered to and training provided, to\nensure the safety of our children and leaders.\nFuture Plans\nA number of aims have been identified for developing the Church and\nits work in 2018:\nContinuing to build a Purpose Driven Church and grow people in\nChristian life and service as missionary disciples.\nThe appointment of an Associate Minster to strengthen our ministry\nteam, provide oversight of our youth work and assist with the many\ninitiatives that are developing\nPhase 2 of the development of the Church site. We intend to agree\nthe vision and outline concept before moving forward to obtaining\ndrawings and plans for a new second building on the site This is a\nlong-term project and teams of people will be formed to take this\nforward.\nLIFE Group attendance. This has fallen over the past few years and\nattempts will be made to get much greater involvement.\nHallingbury Free Church. The Church administers this chapel and\nmanse in a local village. The work is dormant and a decision will be\nmade about its future.\nExternal Links\nThe Church continues to be linked in fellowship to the national\nstructures of the Baptist Union of Great Britain which are expressed locally\nthrough the Eastern Baptist Association.\nThe Church also remains a member of Churches Together in Bishop's\nStortford, the Evangelical Alliance and the Willow Creek Association.\nChurch members take part in the meetings and events of Churches\nTogether and support a number of joint projects. These include Holiday\nBible Week, Street Pastors and 'Thirst' Youth Cafe. Churches also meet\ntogether for a service on Good Friday and for prayer at various times.\nPremises\nWe continue to have a significant property holding and liability which is\nmanaged by a small group of volunteers. The budgetary requirement\ncontinues to be under scrutiny, as we are now starting to see\nelements of the Church Centre where we need to start to consider\nreplacement. To keep to overall budgetary constraints however, we have\nnot yet been making regular provision for such end of life replacements,\nbut we have managed single allocations to these reserves from end-of-\nyear surpluses, SO far totalling E10,000.\nThe Church Centre\n7\nSome design proposals have been made to provide safe access to the\nroof as we need to make easier arrangements for clearing of gutters etc.\nin the future. We hope to finalise this in 2018.\nSome paving has been laid in a small grass area at the side of the\nChurch Centre, mainly replacing some dead turfs, SO that better use can\nbe made of this space.\nA team of dedicated gardeners continue to maintain the grounds, for\nwhich we are very grateful.\nThere have been numerous minor maintenance issues throughout the\nyear, some needing to call on specific talents or employing specialist\ncompanies.\nWe ask Church attendees to advise of any issues that they become\naware of that need attention, SO that we can keep the buildings up to a\nhigh standard. We also like to know of any individuals with gifting relating\nto buildings; God has already provided for our needs, but he does call\neach one of us to offer those gifts back to him.\nThe second building on the site\nThe small offices in the left of this building are being used to some\ndegree to house the language classes and 'Exchange'. The\nremainder of the block remains un-useable due to a lack of safe power\nsupply, lighting or heating which would need considerable investment and\nawaits the development of the finalisation of the vision for this area.\nThe Church Manse\nThere have been some minor issues which needed to be resolved,\nparticularly with regard to the shower and some flooring problems. In the\nnear future we may need to consider updating the bathrooms.\nChurch Membership\nThere has been appreciable growth in membership during the year.\nThe year started with 227 members and ended with 235. We have been\nencouraged by 14 applications for membership whilst only 6 have left; 1\nthrough death, 1 because of infirmity and the remaining 4 have left the\narea.\nWe have been further encouraged by 11 requests for baptism during\nthe year, 7 of whom came into membership and a further 2 have asked\nand we expect them to become members shortly. Of the remainder 1 has\nleft the area temporarily to undergo training.\nWorthy of particular note is that the age profile of Church members\nhas dropped significantly. In recent years the normal distribution has been\ncentred on the 50-60 age group but as the graph below shows this is now\non the 40-50 group.\n8\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nMembership by Age as at December 2017\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n10-19\n20-29\n30-39\n40-49\n50-59\n60-69\n70-79\n80-89\n90+\n'Discover BSBC' groups have again been held for newcomers to the\nChurch to find out more about its beliefs, practices, priorities and\nactivities. These are informal and interactive sessions during which people\ncan also learn the importance of membership within Baptist churches,\nwhere governance is the responsibility of the gathered membership. On\ncompletion of the 3 sessions attendees can decide whether they wish to\napply to become members of the Church. Three 'Discover BSBC' groups\nwere held in May, June and November with a total of 14 attendees.\nStaff and Volunteers\nWe are extremely grateful to the paid staff team who look after the\nChurch Centre and its multitude of activities for the church and\ncommunity each day: John Walford (Senior Minister), Tim Kingston\nHepner (Church Centre Manager), Jo Moore (Personal Assistant to the\nMinisters), Liz Lake (Church Publicist). We hope to appoint an Associate\nMinister in 2018.\nBut nothing would happen effectively either without the enormous\nteam of volunteers that serve SO faithfully in a committed and enthusiastic\nfashion. So many of our members are involved in one way or another.\nAdditionally we pay tribute to the Trustees who have stood down in\n2017 either at the end of their term of office or because of persona\ncircumstances or commitments elsewhere: Keith Bintley, Jonathan\nKisenyi, Trevor McKenzie, Vicki Sweeney, Graham Vernon, Mark Wheeler.\nFinancial Overview\nAll monies received are donations from members and other persons\nassociated with the Church. A small sum is received from the hiring of\npremises to other organisations.\nOverall, planned giving through envelopes and weekly offerings\n(including casual cash gifts) showed an increase compared with the\nprevious year, whereas direct giving by Standing Order decreased.\nOrganisations using the Church Centre for various functions led to\nE11,329 in fees being received.\n9\nTotal receipts for the General Fund (including Gift Aid) were E342,605,\nan increase over the equivalent giving in 2016 (E334,241).\nA total of E75,222 was given to Mission, to similar ministries to 2016.\nOnce Gift Aid had been claimed for the entire year, there was an excess of\nreceipts over payments for the year of E28,323.92\nE2,675 was spent on such items as additional furniture for the\nGathering Area, signage, shelving and other equipment. E60,000 was\nmade towards repayment of the Baptist Union Corporation loan for the\nChurch Centre construction cost, SO that the amount outstanding is now\nE411,093.70. The loan is to be paid back over a period of 15 years, by\n2026.\nThe September Church Meeting decided to commit to financial and\nprayerful support for Tearfund's Church Led Community Transformation\nProject in Vivante Huye Loca Church and Tumba Community in Rwanda.\nThe financial commitment is to contribute E27,763 each November (from\n2017 -2019) from our Specia Gifts Fund. This Fund will need a further\nE21,791.32 to be added in order to be able to fully meet this commitment.\nAs at 31st December 2017 the General Reserve stood at E144,140\nThe Capital Goods Reserve stood at E20,18 The monies held for the\nChurch Centre, Special Projects and gifts towards purchasing the\nremainder of the site (including the remainder of funds held following the\nsale of 37 Hurn Grove in 2015) totalled E180,253.\nThe Church has a Reserves Policy and a minimum sum is stipulated\nwithin this and held within the Genera Reserve. The amount is sufficient\nfor meeting obligations in a three-month period should the Church have to\nbe wound up.\nWorkplace Pensions - Automatic Enrolment\nThe Church is an employer participating in a pension scheme known as\nthe Baptist Ministers' Pension Scheme (""the Scheme""). The Scheme is a\nseparate legal entity which is administered by the Pension Trustee (Baptist\nPension Trust Limited). This satisfies our legal requirement for pension\nprovision for our employees.\nThe Minister and all members of the church staff are eligible to join the\nScheme, which is not contracted out of the State Second Pension.\nFrom January 2012, pension provision is being made through the Defined\nContribution (DC) Plan within the Scheme. In general, members of the\nMinisters' section of the scheme pay 8% of their Pensionable Income and\nemployers pay 6% of members' Pensionable Income into individual\npension accounts, which are operated and managed on behalf of the\nPension Trustee by Legal and General Life Assurance Society Limited. In\naddition, the employer pays a further 4% of Pensionable Income (or 3% if\nthe employer is in the segregated DC section) to cover Death in Service\nBenefits, administration costs, and an associated insurance policy which\nprovides income protection for Scheme members in the event that they\nare unable to work due to long-term incapacity. This income protection\npolicy has been insured by the Baptist Union of Great Britain with Unum\nLimited.\nOur non-ministerial employees are eligible to join the Basic section of\nthe scheme. Members of the Basic Section pay contributions of 5% of\nPensionable Income, and their employers also pay a total of 5%.\nBenefits in respect of service prior to 1 January 2012 are provided\nthrough the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan within the Scheme. The main\nbenefits for pre-2012 service were a defined benefit pension of one\neightieth of Fina Minimum Pensionable Income for each year of\n10\nPensionable Service, together with additional pension in respect of\npremiums paid on Pensionable Income in excess of Minimum Pensionable\nIncome. The Scheme, previously known as the Baptist Ministers' Pension\nFund, started in 1925, but was closed to future accrual of defined benefits\non 31 December 2011.\nA formal valuation of the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan was performed at\n31 December 2013 by a professionally qualified Actuary using the\nProjected Unit Method. The market value of the DB Plan assets at the\nvaluation date was E162 million.\nThis valuation of the DB Plan revealed a deficit of assets compared\nwith the value of liabilities of E84 million (equivalent to a past service\nfunding level of 66%). The deficit is now much higher. As a result of the\nvaluation, in addition to the contributions to the DC Plan set out above, it\nwas agreed to increase the standard rate of deficiency contributions from\nchurches and other employers involved in the DB Plan from 11% of\nPensionable Income/Minimum Pensionable Income to 12% from 1 January\n2016. The contributions are based on each church's or other employer's\nposition at March 2015. Some churches and other employers that were\nonly involved in the DB Plan for a short period now pay less than 12%.\nThe Recovery Plan envisages deficiency contributions continuing until 30\nJune 2035. The Church's individual estimated debt within the Baptist\nPension Scheme is E161,100 based on the service of current and previous\nministers.\nStructure, governance and management\nThe method of appointment of the Leadership Team is set out in the\nChurch Constitution. The Leadership Team consists of the Ministers, the\nElders, the Church Secretary, the Church Treasurer, and the Deacons who\nare elected by Church members. All those who attend our services or who\nare members of the congregation are encouraged to consider Church\nmembership in line with the Church's basis of faith and values.\nThe Church members at the Church Meeting are responsible for\nmaking decisions on all matters of general concern and importance to the\nChurch, including deciding on how the funds of the Church are to be\nspent. They are regularly asked to agree a recommendation brought by\nthe Leadership Team.\nThe Leadership Team met formally 12 times during the year with an\naverage attendance of 75% (2015: 80%) and Church Meetings were held\non 4 occasions with an average attendance of 27% (2016 28%) of the\nmembership. Oversight of the numerous responsibilities and functions in\nthe Church (for example worship, discipleship, outreach) is carried out by\nindividual members of the Leadership Team who are responsible to the\nTeam and to the Church as a whole, and they report regularly on their\nactivities.\nThe Trustees believe they have complied with their duty to have due\nregard to the guidance on public benefit prescribed by the Charities\nCommission in exercising their powers and duties.\nAdministrative Information\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church is affiliated to the Eastern Baptist\nAssociation and to the Baptist Union. The correspondence address is The\n11\nBaptist Church Centre, Twyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, CM23 3LJ. Most\nmeetings are held at the Church Centre, but regular use is also made of\nthe Havers Community Centre in Waytemore Road, Bishop's Stortford.\nThe Church is registered with the Charities Commission as a Charitable\nIncorporated Organisation (number 1159484; Constitution last amended\n21st September 2017).\nThe Leadership Team form the body of Trustees and for 2017 was as\nfollows:\nEx Officio Member:\nSenior Minister\nThe Reverend John Walford\nElected Members:\nElders\nMr Simon Curran\nMr Martin Gill\nMr Trevor McKenzie (resigned 23rd March 2017)\nChurch Secretary\nMr Robin Baker\nChurch Treasurer\nMr Geoffrey Gosling\nDeacons\nMr Keith Bintley (resigned 23rd March 2017)\nMrs Judy Box\nMrs Janet Casson\nMrs Julia Horner\nMr Richard Jones\nDr Jonathan Kisenyi (resigned 23rd March 2017)\nMr Richard Lake (elected 23rd March 2017)\nMrs Tracy Moreton\nMrs Wendy Shipperlee\nMr Peter Solway\nMrs Vicki Sweeney (resigned 12th October 2017)\nMr Barry Tallintire\nMr Graham Vernon (resigned 23rd March 2017)\nMr Mark Wheeler (resigned 23rd March 2017)\nA Sroven 6, chunl heeta\n22(319\nLosDua\ncLuni Jevetu\n12\nbishops stortford baptist church\n2017\nCHURCH ACCOUNTS\nFor Annual Church Meeting\n22nd March 2018\nbishops stortford baptist church\nBishop' Stortford Baptist Church\nThis Church aims to be a community of believers living according to the Bible's teaching\nwhere people become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\n15th February 2018\nIndependent Examiners' Report to the Trustees of\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nRespective Responsibilities of Trustees and Examiners\nWe report on the accounts of the church for the year ended 31st December 2017\nThe church's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts. The church trustees\nconsider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the Charities Act 2011 (the\n2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is our responsibility to:\nExamine the accounts under Section 145 of the 2011 Act;\nTo follow the procedures laid down in the General Directions given by the Charity\nCommissioners under Section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\nTo state whether particular matters have come to our attention\nBasis of Independent Examiners' Report\nOur examination was carried out in accordance with the General Directions given by the Charities\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the church and a\ncomparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration of any\nunusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from the trustees concerning\nany such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the evidence that would be required\nin an audit and consequently no opinion is given as to whether the accounts present a ""true and fair\nview"" and the report is limited to those matters set out in the statement below.\nIndependent Examiners' Statement\nSince the gross income for the year exceeds the amount provided in Section 145(3) of the Act, we\nconfirm that we are qualified to act as Independent examiners under the provisions of that section of\nthe Act and that Tanne Shorter's qualification is as shown below.\nIn connection with our examination, no matter has come to our attention:\nWhich gives us reasonable cause to believe that in any material respect the requirements:\nTo keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of The Act; and\nTo prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with the\naccounting requirements of the 2011 Act have not been met; or\nTo which, in our opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper understanding\nof the accounts to be reached.\n-G-lse\n1\nMr Michael Casson\nMrs Tracey Crocker\nMrs Tanne Shorter ACA\n4, Pearse House\nHatchetts Cottage,\n206 Stansted Road\nBirchwood Mews\nBeggarmans Lane,\nBishop's Stortford\nBishop's Stortford,\nOld Hall Green,\nCM23 2AR\nCM23 5FA\nNr Ware SG11 1HB\nBaptist Church Centre\nTwyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, CM23 3LJ\n: 01279 836695 churchoffice@stortfordbaptist.org\nwww.stortfordbaptist.org\nRegistered Charity No. 1159484\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Financial Activities\nFor the period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nUnrestricted\nRestricted\nEndowment\nTotal\nPrior year\nfunds\nfunds\nfunds\nfunds\ntotal funds\nIncome and endowments from:\nDonations and legacies\n341,023.40\n-\n-\n341,023.40\n332,078.62\nInvestments\n1,581.42\n-\n-\n1,581.42\n2,162.65\nTotal income and endowments from:\n342,604.82\n-\n-\n342,604.82\n334,241.27\nExpenditure on:\nExpenditure on charitable activities\n309,341.57\n-\n-\n309,341.57\n341,455.31\nTotal expenditure on:\n309,341.57\n-\n-\n309,341.57\n341,455.31\nNet income / (expenditure)\n33,263.25\n-\n-\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\nTransfers\nGross transfers between funds in\n72,491.68\n-\n123.00\n72,614.68\n94,570.71\nGross transfers between funds - out\n(72,491.68)\n-\n(123.00)\n(72,614.68)\n(94,570.71)\nNet income / (expenditure)\n33,263.25\n-\n-\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\nOther recognised gains / losses\nGains 1 losses on investment assets\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGains on revaluation, fixed assets, charity's own use\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet movement in funds\n33,263.25\n-\n-\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\nReconciliation of funds\nTotal funds brought forward\n458,754.21\n6,381.50\n-\n465,135.71\n472,349.75\nTotal funds carried forward\n492,017.46\n6,381.50\n-\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\n24 January 2018 Page 1\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Recommended Practice\nFor the Period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nTotal Funds\nPrior Year Funds\nFixed assets\nTangible assets\n0.00\n0.00\nCurrent assets\nDebtors (Accounts Receivable)\n77,461.26\n51,515.36\nInvestments\n411,003.34\n390,183.94\nCash at bank/ in hand\n9,934.36\n23,436.41\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nLiabilities\nCreditors: (Amounts falling\ndue after more than one year)\n0.00\n0.00\nNet current assets/(liabilities)\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nTotal assets less current liabilities\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nTotal net assets / (liabilities)\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nThe funds of the charity\nEndowment\n0.00\n0.00\nRestricted\n6,381.50\n6,381.50\nDesignated\n463,693.54\n458,656.90\nUnrestricted income funds\n28,323.92\n97.31\nThe funds of the charity\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nBalance Sheet detailed\nAs at\nAs at\n31/12/2017\n31/12/2016\nFixed assets\nOTHER: various small fixed assets\n-\n-\nPASYSTEM: P A System for Worship\n-\n-\nTotal Fixed assets\n-\n-\nCurrent assets\nBU DEPOSIT: Baptist Union Deposit Acc\n310,594.19\n309,395.72\nCA001 Bank Current Acc (Lloyds)\n9,663.71\n17,417.17\nCA003: Deposit Acc (Lloyds)\n56,699.56\n43,088.94\nCA005: Cash in Hand (Office)\n101.42\n126.43\nCA006: Cash in hand (Treasurer)\n169.23\n226.78\nCA013: Saffron BS Corp Tracker Bond\n38,032.23\n37,699.28\nCA014: Saffron BS Loyalty Corporate Account\n5,677.36\n5,666.03\nZ05: Accounts Receivable\n77,461.26\n51,515.36\nTotal Current assets\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nLiabilities\nZ04: Accounts Payable\n-\n-\nZ10: NCC Loan 5\n-\n-\nTotal Liabilities\n-\n-\nNet Asset surplus (deficit)\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nReserves\nExcess / (deficit) to date\n33,263.25\n-\nZ01: Starting balances\n465,135.71\n465,135.71\nTotal Reserves\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nRepresented by Funds\nUnrestricted\n28,323.92\n97.31\nDesignated\n463,693.54\n458,656.90\nRestricted\n6,381.50\n6,381.50\nEndowment\n-\n-\nTotal\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\n12 March 2018\nPage 1\nBAPTIST CHURCH\nBishop's Stortford\nSTATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER 2017\n2017 INCOME & EXPENDITURE\nBudget 2017\n2016\nINCOME\n2017\nBudget 2017\n2016\nEXPENDITURE\n2017\nBALANCE\nBrought forward\nE\n97.31\nE\n9.909.94\nGENERAL EXPENDITURE\nGENERAL INCOME\nMINISTRY & OUTREACH\nMinister.

The Church's\nmission is to enable people to become fully devoted followers of jesus\nChrist by the power of the Holy Spirit. To that end, we understand the\npurposes of the Church to be worship, discipleship, fellowship, outreach\nand service. The fellowship of the Church seeks to go deeper with God,\nbecome closer to each other and wider in our influence.\nObjectives and Overview\nThe Church is committed to carrying out its activities in line with the\nBaptist tradition and to encourage and enable people in the local area to\nattend and take part in its services and meetings. Activities include:\n~\nServices each week for worship, prayer, Bible study, preaching and\nteaching, including additional services for those in the local area\nwhose first language is not English\n~\nBaptisms on request\n~\nMeetings for young people\n~\nSmall group meetings (LIFE Groups) for all ages\n~\nPastoral care\n~\nDiscipleship for Christian service\n~\nEvangelism and mission\n~\nSupport of Christian and social charitable action within the local\narea\n~\nSupport for mission overseas\n~\nInvolvement with the local and national Baptist associations\nThe ministry areas of the Church are classified into Worship,\nFellowship, Reaching Out, Discipleship and Social Action, supplemented by\na Resources Team (all led by the Deacons) and with spiritual oversight\nand pastoral care administered by the Elders.\nChurch Activities\nWorship, Teaching and Prayer\nOur Sunday morning service of worship continues to be the largest\nevent in the Church's life and the point when the Church Community\ncomes together. In 2017 we began to see a growing number of people in\nmembership but fewer people attending on a weekly basis. This seems to\nreflect the pressures on people's lives to spread themselves between\nmany different needs. Consequently the average number of weekly\nattenders was slightly lower but the total number of worshippers grew. As\nbefore a greater number are attending during the main festivals, with our\nnumbers peaking on Easter Day and for our Carol Service. In addition to\nour morning service we also have a smaller Sunday evening service and a\nSunday afternoon Portuguese language service. In 2017 in the mornings\nwe looked at:\nCultivating a healthy soul\nBecoming Missionary Disciples\nActs 1-8\nMatthew 5-6\nRecovering the Image of God\nAn Advent series thinking of God's love coming to us\nIn the evenings we looked at:\nGalatians\nIsaiah\nJames\nAs previously, a committed team of worship leaders and the preaching\nteam are involved in leading services. Our Senior Minister took a time of\nsabbatical during which various guest speakers were involved. We once\nagain ran a series of 'Deeper' in the spring; offering a more interactive\napproach than a typical evening service, with in-depth teaching entitled:\n'What good is the Law' followed by small group discussion. On the second\nSunday evening of each month we have continued to run our informal\n'Refresh' service. During the year we also had the opportunity to hold\nservices for a local school and our local Mencap centre.\nVarious members of the congregation lead prayer in services and people\ncan also seek personal prayer after each service. We have a dedicated\nPrayer Room and prayers are held there weekdays at noon. Prayer is a\nvital component of our small group meetings during the week. Prayer\nBreakfasts have been held during the year with differing formats and\nstyles. These have been made family friendly so they provide a good\nopportunity for people of all ages to come and enjoy fellowship and pray\nin an informal setting.\nDiscipleship\nA new Deacon to head up Discipleship was appointed in March 2017,\nwith the aim of building a culture of discipleship in various forms. The\nChurch strategy is primarily to promote and develop small groups, which\nare designed to be an informal space where members can build\nrelationships, deepen faith and grow as disciples. During the year, these\ngroups were rebranded as LIFE Groups to better reflect their purpose\nwhich is to share the life that Jesus gives in a smaller setting. The\ngroup leaders met together twice in 2017 to encourage each other, share\nideas, discuss challenges, consider the future development of the\ngroups, and how to grow group attendance. A survey of non-attenders\nwas carried out in November. Encouragement to the congregation to\nattend groups continues to be given in morning services. A new group\nhas been established to nurture new Christians who have been through\nthe Alpha course that the Church runs. The group notice board and\nChurch web site have been also updated to reflect the changes.\nA new men's ministry is under consideration to enable informal\ncross-generational mentoring and spiritual growth. This is seen as\nparticularly valuable for the younger adults, but would benefit all\nthose involved through the building of relationships. Mutual\naccountability partnerships for men and women are also being promoted\nacross the wider Church.\nOrganisation of the Church library has progressed with the removal\nof dated or duplicated books. Modern study and reference books have\nbeen purchased which are for the use of LIFE group leaders and those\nwho may need resources for sermon preparation. The purchase of\nfurther books is planned, and the overhaul of group resources continues.\nRegular book promotions and the sale of books to make printed resources\nas accessible as possible are intended. Bible reading notes are also\navailable for children, young people and adults with the opportunity to\ntry out the notes before buying.\nXnternational Ministry\nIn June, we celebrated our 10th Anniversary of the International\nMinistry and give thanks for God's faithfulness over the years.\nGustavo Gubiani has been appointed as International Ministry Leader,\nbut Tracy Moreton is still very much engaged and responsible for\ndeveloping Language Programmes and International Events.\n'Cafe and\nCompanhia' has proved very successful with between 10 and 20 ladies\nattending.\n'International Cafe' was launched in November, planned as a\nmonthly activity. Students from the language programme have attended\nboth events which provides an opportunity for bridge building. This year\nmost of the students are from the local community. Both initiatives are\nfocusing on reaching out.\nThe Portuguese speaking congregation has been experiencing a deeper\nknowledge of Christ, that is gradually being reflected in their walk with\neach other and society. The weekly Portuguese Service has an attendance\nof between 20-30 (adults and children) and has become well known by\nothers. Alongside the services, discipleship classes and pastoral care is\nbeing given. Marcela Gubiani assists in this ministry and helps with the\nladies (outreach and care) and teaching of the children. A Portuguese LIFE\ngroup has started once a week, as another way to connect with people\noutside the Church building, enabling the group to pray together, support\neach other and use their gifts.\nThe International Ministry continues with the vision to draw people in\nfrom the wider town community and is very effective in aiding the\nInternational Community to feel fully included in the Church family.\nSocial Action\nOur focus is to engage with our local community and make a difference\nthrough our four aims:\nSupporting those in need, particularly the poorer in society and\nthose struggling financially.\nSupporting community groups who meet specific needs in our local\narea.\nCaring for the local environment.\nFellowship.\nA wide variety of social action projects have been ongoing throughout\nthe year, including the Bishops Stortford Money Advice Service. However,\nhighlights and changes during 2017 were:\nExchange —we have been working mainly with the local Children' s\nCentre this year and have been able to help two people with furniture\nstorage after they had been made homeless.\nBishops Stortford Food Bank —a new co-ordinator has been appointed\nand will be increasing the opening times from 3 days to 4 in February\n2018.\nToddlers —Remains very popular, and many of the Toddlers families\nhave also attended Messy Church.\nYMCA —is now part of YMCA East Herts, so the manager has moved on\nand a new management team is in place.\nStreet Pastors —Has a new co-ordinator and has teams going out most\nFriday evenings.\nGrove Cottage —We are hoping that the Puppets Galore team will be\nable to run some sessions at Grove Cottage, and we may be able to help\nthe Grove Cottage Life Skills Coach to find useful work experience for their\nmembers.\nCanal Adoption —Our Waterways Chaplain has now moved away to\nNewbury to minister on the waterways there, but we are still working with\nthe Canal fk River Trust to maintain and improve the canal by the Church.\nReaching Out\nOverview\nWe continue to seek to weave the thread of evangelism through all\nour Church ministry areas and activities, to draw people closer to God and\ngive the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Him. Our Church\nbuilding, our Services, our welcome and fellowship, should all reflect\nChrist's Love. We also look to extend a wider influence in the local\ncommunity, as we try to draw a diverse selection of people into our\npremises, and as we also hold a variety of events at different venues\naround the area.\nL cork\nWe ran an Alpha course again this year with one guest, who has gone on\nto be baptised, become a Church member and join one of our LIFE\nGroups.\nFitness —Circuit Training classes for both sexes are running on Monday\nevenings with a core class of 12. Approximately half the class do not\nattend the Church, although some of them are friends of Church\nmembers.\nFlower Arranging continues as an occasional course with The Lonely\nBouquet Scheme now established as a successful spin-off, by putting\nany left-over blooms to good use. This year, other churches in the town\nwere invited to join together over Easter, to cover our community with\nLonely Bouquets. In spite of relatively short notice, two other churches\ntook part, and we hope to build on this in the future.\nMessy Church. We had two successful events this year, at Easter and\nHalloween. Over 100 people attended both, which were much enjoyed.\nThis year included the ever-popular puppets, as well as flower arranging\nand also two new activities, a 'Bake Off' and 'Lego Master Builder'; both\nproved very successful. Many of those who attended would not normally\ncome along to a church service.\nTable Tennis —this continues as a youth event with participating\nnumbers, but not enthusiasm, gradually dropping over the year. The\nintroduction of a short Biblical talk in the half-time break, has now become\nestablished and provokes more discussion and participation.\n~Wor\nM~ii n\nSome while ago, the Church committed 10% of a large legacy that it\nreceived to overseas mission work, and specifically for work in Rwanda.\nWe have now agreed a partnership with Tearfund for Church Led\nCommunity Transformation in the Vivante Huye Local Church and\nTumba Community in Rwanda. This is a three-year project and\nmeasures have been agreed for this to be closely monitored with quarterly\nreports from Tearfund on progress, visits from Tearfund speakers to\nprovide updates and visits to the project by Church members.\nFor Mission Sunday, in May, we had the honour to have David Kerrigan,\nthe retiring Leader of BMS World Mission come and speak to us about\ntheir newly published Mission Development Programme, set to achieve its\nintended ambitious goals by 2020. We were complemented on our faithful\nfinancial support for BMS, where we fall into the top 10% of contributing\nchurches.\nWe continue to support Roland fk Carolien Smith and their work with\nEuropean Christian Mission in the Netherlands, Eric and Claire\nSingirankabo in Rwanda and Lizzie and Paul Reed seeking to continue\ntheir work in Russia. We have links with Kate 8a Storly Michel\nministering to Haiti.\nWe have also adopted BMS missionaries Sergio and Liz Vilela, working\nwith youth and children in Mozambique. We support them through our\ncontribution to BMS World Mission and also get regular prayer updates\nand access to their blogs via our website. Previously they were both youth\npastors at Saffron Waldon Baptist Church and Liz also worked with Stort\nValley Schools Trust, to which we are closely connected.\nOur family Harvest Service related to BMS World Mission this year too,\nwhere we highlighted the work being done in Thailand with severely\ndisabled children who cannot be cared for by their families. Titled\n'Wonderfully Made' and portraying the children as 'Super Heroes', our\nSunday Club classes really got behind the theme, and with the help of\ntheir leaders, contributed much to the success of the service. We were\nvery much encouraged by the efforts of one little girl, who later went on\nto organise a cake sale to raise funds for this cause too.\nFellowship (2017)\nOverview\nIt has been very encouraging over the past year to see how the fellowship\nof believers at the Church is deepening its commitment to each other and\nto the wider community.\nThe new 'Friends Together' initiative on the second and fourth Friday of\nevery month at Caffe Nero is meeting a need for informal fellowship and\nan opportunity to bring other friends along. There is a core group of\npeople from the Church who are committed to supporting it. Besides\nregular attenders, over the months many people have popped in and\nspent time over tea or coffee, broadening friendships and getting to know\nmore about each other, understanding needs and giving support.\nIt is hoped that the planned Cafe at the Church 'Breaking Bread' on a\nTuesday afternoon will fulfil a similar need, as well as providing a safe\nplace to enjoy fellowship with each other and the local community. The\nnew furniture in the Gathering Area is intended to make the environment\nmore welcoming and purposeful. New noticeboards have been installed to\ngive information on the different areas of the Church's work and a new\ndisplay counter with leaflets advertising and promoting what we do is soon\nto be installed.\nAn extended welcome team are set to begin an approach whereby\nnewcomers can enjoy a welcoming fellowship lunch, together with existing\nmembers and worshippers who have a heart for hospitality.\nThe Baptist Women's Link (BWL) continues to thrive with ladies (and\nsome gentlemen) enjoying fellowship. The members enjoy varied talks\nand activities, lifts are organised, special occasions (such as the Christmas\ncard sale, lunches and teas) are catered for, and members are visited at\nother times of the week - all a regular feature of this group. Our\ncommitted leader over several years, Sheila Vernon, is stepping down in\nApril 2018 and a new leader is needed for September 2018 onwards.\nThe Contact Group continues to provide valuable fellowship to our folk\nwho are elderly and unable to get out of their homes. Together with BWL\nthey had a very enjoyable Summer outing to The Gardens of Easton\nLodge in July which was only made possible due to our volunteer mini-bus\ndrivers and the ladies who prepared a delicious tea at the Church. This\ntruly reflects the quality of our fellowship here, that so many people are\nprepared to give of their time to facilitate a welcome treat for these\npeople.\nChildren and Youth (2017)\nThe children and youth work continued positively with a fantastic team\nof committed leaders. On a Sunday morning we have regular contact with\nabout 100 children and young people (mainly children with parents in\nChurch), where we learn about God's word for us, how we get to know\nhim, and how we can follow his will for our lives. During the week we\ncontinued with the various youth clubs where we see many other young\npeople from the local area come to get to know us and hear something of\nhow God loves them.\nOne or two activities, such as GROW and the parent workshops,\nstopped during the year where we felt they had run their course or where\nwe used our resources elsewhere. However we had the joy of seeing\nYouth Church start where, once or twice a term, alongside the main\nmorning service there is a separate service for the young people to come\ntogether for worship, learning, discussion and prayer. Seeing some of the\nyoung people from Zone (the Friday evening club) come along to this has\nbeen tremendous.\nAlso this year Heather Martin and Beth Walford have started a\nDiscipleship Group for the older girls, who share a meal together with time\nand space to relax, chat, ask questions and provide support for one\nanother.\nWe await the appointment of a new Associate Minister who will have\noversight of the work. In the meantime special mention should once again\nbe made of Heather for her enthusiasm and commitment to the young\npeople and to Jo Moore for her skillful organisation of, and unwavering\nsupport to, the volunteer leaders. This includes ensuring the Safeguarding\nPolicy is kept up to date, rigorously adhered to and training provided, to\nensure the safety of our children and leaders.\nFuture Plans\nA number of aims have been identified for developing the Church and\nits work in 2018:\n~\nContinuing to build a Purpose Driven Church and grow people in\nChristian life and service as missionary disciples.\n~\nThe appointment of an Associate Minster to strengthen our ministry\nteam, provide oversight of our youth work and assist with the many\ninitiatives that are developing\n~\nPhase 2 of the development of the Church site. We intend to agree\nthe vision and outline concept before moving forward to obtaining\ndrawings and plans for a new second building on the site This is a\nlong-term project and teams of people will be formed to take this\nforward.\n~\nLIFE Group attendance. This has fallen over the past few years and\nattempts will be made to get much greater involvement.\n~\nHallingbury Free Church. The Church administers this chapel and\nmanse in a local village. The work is dormant and a decision will be\nmade about its future.\nExternal Links\nThe Church continues to be linked in fellowship to the national\nstructures of the Baptist Union of Great Britain which are expressed locally\nthrough the Eastern Baptist Association.\nThe Church also remains a member of Churches Together in Bishop' s\nStorfford, the Evangelical Alliance and the Willow Creek Association.\nChurch members take part in the meetings and events of Churches\nTogether and support a number of joint projects. These include Holiday\nBible Week, Street Pastors and 'Thirst' Youth Cafe. Churches also meet\ntogether for a service on Good Friday and for prayer at various times.\nPremises\nWe continue to have a significant property holding and liability which is\nmanaged by a small group of volunteers. The budgetary requirement\ncontinues to be under scrutiny, as we are now starting to see\nelements of the Church Centre where we need to start to consider\nreplacement. To keep to overall budgetary constraints however, we have\nnot yet been making regular provision for such end of life replacements,\nbut we have managed single allocations to these reserves from end-of-\nyear surpluses, so far totalling E10,000.\nThe Church Centre\nSome design proposals have been made to provide safe access to the\nroof as we need to make easier arrangements for clearing of gutters etc.\nin the future. We hope to finalise this in 2018.\nSome paving has been laid in a small grass area at the side of the\nChurch Centre, mainly replacing some dead turfs, so that better use can\nbe made of this space.\nA team of dedicated gardeners continue to maintain the grounds, for\nwhich we are very grateful.\nThere have been numerous minor maintenance issues throughout the\nyear, some needing to call on specific talents or employing specialist\ncompanies.\nWe ask Church attendees to advise of any issues that they become\naware of that need attention, so that we can keep the buildings up to a\nhigh standard. We also like to know of any individuals with gifting relating\nto buildings; God has already provided for our needs, but he does call\neach one of us to offer those gifts back to him.\nThe second building on the site\nThe small offices in the left of this building are being used to some\ndegree to house the language classes and 'Exchange'. The\nremainder of the block remains un-useable due to a lack of safe power\nsupply, lighting or heating which would need considerable investment and\nawaits the development of the finalisation of the vision for this area.\nThe Church Manse\nThere have been some minor issues which needed to be resolved,\nparticularly with regard to the shower and some flooring problems. In the\nnear future we may need to consider updating the bathrooms.\nChurch Membership\nThere has been appreciable growth in membership during the year.\nThe year started with 227 members and ended with 235. We have been\nencouraged by 14 applications for membership whilst only 6 have left; 1\nthrough death, 1 because of infirmity and the remaining 4 have left the\narea.\nWe have been further encouraged by 11 requests for baptism during\nthe year, 7 of whom came into membership and a further 2 have asked\nand we expect them to become members shortly. Of the remainder 1 has\nleft the area temporarily to undergo training.\nWorthy of particular note is that the age profile of Church members\nhas dropped significantly. In recent years the normal distribution has been\ncentred on the 50-60 age group but as the graph below shows this is now\non the 40-50 group.\n60\nBishop's Storfford Baptist Church\nMembership by Age as at December 2017\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\nti;.j:"","",l~+g'4, cj,bi .\n~\n-'1~v\n0.i\n.""l ~,\ng fNe\n„-egg~,~~j!;\n0\n10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60 -69 70-79 80-89 90+\n'Discover BSBC' groups have again been held for newcomers to the\nChurch to find out more about its beliefs, practices, priorities and\nactivities. These are informal and interactive sessions during which people\ncan also learn the importance of membership within Baptist churches,\nwhere governance is the responsibility of the gathered membership. On\ncompletion of the 3 sessions attendees can decide whether they wish to\napply to become members of the Church. Three 'Discover BSBC' groups\nwere held in May, June and November with a total of 14 attendees.\nStaff and Volunteers\nWe are extremely grateful to the paid staff team who look after the\nChurch Centre and its multitude of activities for the church and\ncommunity each day: John Walford (Senior Minister), Tim Kingston\nHepner (Church Centre Manager), Jo Moore (Personal Assistant to the\nMinisters), Liz Lake (Church Publicist). We hope to appoint an Associate\nMinister in 2018.\nBut nothing would happen effectively either without the enormous\nteam of volunteers that serve so faithfully in a committed and enthusiastic\nfashion. So many of our members are involved in one way or another.\nAdditionally we pay tribute to the Trustees who have stood down in\n2017 either at the end of their term of office or because of personal\ncircumstances or commitments elsewhere: Keith Bintley, Jonathan\nKisenyi, Trevor McKenzie, Vicki Sweeney, Graham Vernon, Mark Wheeler.\nFinancial Overview\nAll monies received are donations from members and other persons\nassociated with the Church. A small sum is received from the hiring of\npremises to other organisations.\nOverall, planned giving through envelopes and weekly offerings\n(including casual cash gifts) showed an increase compared with the\nprevious year, whereas direct giving by Standing Order decreased.\nOrganisations using the Church Centre for various functions led to\nf11,329 in fees being received.\nTotal receipts for the General Fund (including Gift Aid) were 6342, 605,\nan increase over the equivalent giving in 2016 (f334,241).\nA total of F75, 222 was given to Mission, to similar ministries to 2016.\nOnce Gift Aid had been claimed for the entire year, there was an excess of\nreceipts over payments for the year of f28, 323.92\n62, 675 was spent on such items as additional furniture for the\nGathering Area, signage, shelving and other equipment. 660,000 was\nmade towards repayment of the Baptist Union Corporation loan for the\nChurch Centre construction cost, so that the amount outstanding is now\nf411,093.70. The loan is to be paid back over a period of 15 years, by\n2026.\nThe September Church Meeting decided to commit to financial and\nprayerful support for Tearfund's Church Led Community Transformation\nProject in Vivante Huye Local Church and Tumba Community in Rwanda.\nThe financial commitment is to contribute 627, 763 each November (from\n2017 -2019) from our Special Gifts Fund. This Fund will need a further\nf21,791.32 to be added in order to be able to fully meet this commitment.\nAs at 31st December 2017 the General Reserve stood at E144,140.\nThe Capital Goods Reserve stood at f20, 183. The monies held for the\nChurch Centre, Special Projects and gifts towards purchasing the\nremainder of the site (including the remainder of funds held following the\nsale of 37 Hum Grove in 2015) totalled f180,253.\nThe Church has a Reserves Policy and a minimum sum is stipulated\nwithin this and held within the General Reserve. The amount is sufficient\nfor meeting obligations in a three-month period should the Church have to\nbe wound up.\nWorkplace Pensions —Automatic Enrolment\nThe Church is an employer participating in a pension scheme known as\nthe Baptist Ministers' Pension Scheme (""the Scheme"" ). The Scheme is a\nseparate legal entity which is administered by the Pension Trustee (Baptist\nPension Trust Limited). This satisfies our legal requirement for pension\nprovision for our employees.\nThe Minister and all members of the church staff are eligible to join the\nScheme, which is not contracted out of the State Second Pension.\nFrom january 2012, pension provision is being made through the Defined\nContribution (DC) Plan within the Scheme. In general, members of the\nMinisters' section of the scheme pay 8% of their Pensionable Income and\nemployers pay 6% of members' Pensionable Income into individual\npension accounts, which are operated and managed on behalf of the\nPension Trustee by Legal and General Life Assurance Society Limited. In\naddition, the employer pays a further 4% of Pensionable Income (or 3% if\nthe employer is in the segregated DC section) to cover Death in Service\nBenefits, administration costs, and an associated insurance policy which\nprovides income protection for Scheme members in the event that they\nare unable to work due to long-term incapacity. This income protection\npolicy has been insured by the Baptist Union of Great Britain with Unum\nLimited.\nOur non-ministerial employees are eligible to join the Basic section of\nthe scheme. Members of the Basic Section pay contributions of 5% of\nPensionable Income, and their employers also pay a total of 5%.\nBenefits in respect of service prior to 1 january 2012 are provided\nthrough the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan within the Scheme. The main\nbenefits for pre-2012 service were a defined benefit pension of one\neightieth of Final Minimum Pensionable Income for each year of\nio\nPensionable Service, together with additional pension in respect of\npremiums paid on Pensionable Income in excess of Minimum Pensionable\nIncome. The Scheme, previously known as the Baptist Ministers' Pension\nFund, started in 1925, but was closed to future accrual of defined benefits\non 31 December 2011.\nA formal valuation of the Defined Benefit (DB) Plan was performed at\n31 December 2013 by a professionally qualified Actuary using the\nProjected Unit Method. The market value of the DB Plan assets at the\nvaluation date was E162 million.\nThis valuation of the DB Plan revealed a deficit of assets compared\nwith the value of liabilities of 684 million (equivalent to a past service\nfunding level of 660/0). The deficit is now much higher. As a result of the\nvaluation, in addition to the contributions to the DC Plan set out above, it\nwas agreed to increase the standard rate of deficiency contributions from\nchurches and other employers involved in the DB Plan from 11'/0 of\nPensionable Income/Minimum Pensionable Income to 120/0 from 1 January\n2016. The contributions are based on each church's or other employer's\nposition at March 2015. Some churches and other employers that were\nonly involved in the DB Plan for a short period now pay less than 12'/0.\nThe Recovery Plan envisages deficiency contributions continuing until 30\nJune 2035. The Church's individual estimated debt within the Baptist\nPension Scheme is E161,100, based on the service of current and previous\nministers.\nStructure, governance and management\nThe method of appointment of the Leadership Team is set out in the\nChurch Constitution. The Leadership Team consists of the Ministers, the\nElders, the Church Secretary, the Church Treasurer, and the Deacons who\nare elected by Church members. All those who attend our services or who\nare members of the congregation are encouraged to consider Church\nmembership in line with the Church's basis of faith and values.\nThe Church members at the Church Meeting are responsible for\nmaking decisions on all matters of general concern and importance to the\nChurch, including deciding on how the funds of the Church are to be\nspent. They are regularly asked to agree a recommendation brought by\nthe Leadership Team.\nThe Leadership Team met formally 12 times during the year with an\naverage attendance of 75'/0 (2015: 80'/0) and Church Meetings were held\non 4 occasions with an average attendance of 27'/0 (2016: 28'/0) of the\nmembership. Oversight of the numerous responsibilities and functions in\nthe Church (for example worship, discipleship, outreach) is carried out by\nindividual members of the Leadership Team who are responsible to the\nTeam and to the Church as a whole, and they report regularly on their\nactivities.\nThe Trustees believe they have complied with their duty to have due\nregard to the guidance on public benefit prescribed by the Charities\nCommission in exercising their powers and duties.\nAdministrative Information\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church is affiliated to the Eastern Baptist\nAssociation and to the Baptist Union. The correspondence address is The\n11\nBaptist Church Centre, Twyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, CM23 3U. Most\nmeetings are held at the Church Centre, but regular use is also made of\nthe Havers Community Centre in Waytemore Road, Bishop's Stortford.\nThe Church is registered with the Charities Commission as a Charitable\nIncorporated Organisation (number 1159484; Constitution last amended\n21"" September 2017).\nThe Leadership Team form the body of Trustees and for 2017 was as\nfollows:\nEx Officio Member\nSenior Minister\nElected Members:\nElders\nChurch Secretary\nChurch Treasurer\nDeacons\nThe Reverend John Walford\nMr Simon Curran\nMr Martin Gill\nMr Trevor McKenzie (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMr Robin Baker\nMr Geoffrey Gosling\nMr Keith Bintley (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMrs Judy Box\nMrs Janet Casson\nMrs Julia Horner\nMr Richard Jones\nDr Jonathan Kisenyi (resigned 23""' March 2017)\nMr Richard Lake (elected 23'4 March 2017)\nMrs Tracy Moreton\nMrs Wendy Shipperlee\nMr Peter Solway\nMrs Vicki Sweeney (resigned 12"" October 2017)\nMr Barry Tallintire\nMr Graham Vernon (resigned 23"" March 2017)\nMr Mark Wheeler (resigned 23' March 2017)\nbishops stortford baptist church\n2017\nCHURCH ACCOUNTS\nFor Annual Church Meeting\n22' March 201S\nbtshops storttord tophet church\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nThis Church aims to be a community of believets Bving according to the Bible's teaching\nwhere people become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\n15'"" February 2018\nindependent Examiners' Report to the Trustees of\nBishop's Stoifford Baptist Church\nRespective Responsibilities of Trustees and Examiners\nWe report on the accounts of the church for the year ended 31""December 2017.\nThe church's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts. The church trustees\nconsider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the Charities Act 2011 (the\n2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is our responsibility to:\n~\nExamine the accounts under Section 145 of the 2011 Act;\n~\nTo follow the procedures laid down in the General Directions given by the Charity\nCommissioners under Section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\n~\nTo state whether particular matters have come to our attention.\nBasis of Independent Examiners' Report\nOur examination was carried out in accordance with the General Directions given by the Charities\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the church and a\ncomparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration of any\nunusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from the trustees concerning\nany such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the evidence that would be required\nin an audit and consequently no opinion is given as to whether the accounts present a ""true and fair\nview"" and the report is limited to those matters set out in the statement below.\nindependent Examiners' Statement\nSince the gross income for the year exceeds the amount provided in Section 145(3) of the Act, we\nconfirm that we are qualified to act as Independent examiners under the provisions of that section of\nthe Act and that Tenne Shorter's qualification is as shown below.\nIn connection with our examination, no matter has come to our attention:\n~\nWhich gives us reasonable cause to believe that in any material respect the requirements:\nto To keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of The Act; and\no To prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with the\naccounting requirements of the 2011 Act have not been met; or\n~\nTo which, in our opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper understanding\nof the accounts to be reached.\n( yt-c\nMr Michael Casson~\nMrs Tracey Crocker\n4, Pearse House\nHatchetts Cottage,\nBirchwood Mews\nBeggarmans Lane,\nBishop's Stortford,\nOld Hall Green,\nCM23 5FA\nNr Ware SG11 1HB\nMrs Tanne Shorler ACA\n206 Stansted Road\nBishop's Stortford\nCM23 2AR\nBaptist Church Centre\nK3: Twyford Road, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, CM23 3LJ\n't ': 01279 836695 t:ts churchofftceCastortfordbaptist. org\nt ft: www. stortfordbaptist. org\nRegistered Charity No. 1159484\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Financial Activities\nFor the period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nUnrestricted\nfunds\nRestricted\nEndowment\nfunds\nfunds\nTotal\nPrior year\nfunds\ntotal funds\nincome end endowments burnt\nDonations and legacies\nInvestments\nTotal income and endowments from:\nExpenditure on:\nExpenditure on charitable aciwities\nTotal expenditure on:\n341,023.40\n1,581.42\n342,604.82\n309,341.57\n309,341.57\n341,023 40 332,078 62\n1,581 42\n2, 162 65\n342, 604.82\n334,241.27\n309,341.57\n341,455 31\n309,341.57 341,455.31\nNet income I (expenditum)\n33,263.25\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\nTranafem\nGross trsnsfem between funds —in\nGross transfers between funds —out\nNet income I (expenditure)\nOcher recognised gains I losses\nGains I losses on investment assets\nGains on revaluation, gxed assets, chanty's own use\nNet movement in funds\nReconciliation of funds\nTotal funds brought forward\nTotal tunds carried forward\n72,491 68\n(72,491.68)\n33,263.25\n33,263.25\n458,754.21\n6,381.50\n492,017.46\n6,381.50\n123.00\n72,614.68\n94,570 71\n(123.00) (72,614.68) (94,570.71)\n33,283.25\n(7,214.04)\n33,263.25\n(7,214.04)\n465,135.71\n472, 349.75\n498,398.96 465,135.71\n24 January 2018 Page 1\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nStatement of Recommended Practice\nFor the Period from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017\nTotal Funds\nPrior Year Funds\nFixed assets\nTangible assets\n0.00\n0.00\nCurrent assets\nDebtors (Accounts Receivable)\nInvestments\nCash at bank/ in hand\nLiabilities\nCreditOrS: (Amounts falling\ndue after more than one year)\n77,461.26\n411,003.34\n9 934.36\n498 398.96\n0.00\n51,515.36\n390,183.94\n23 436.41\n465 135.11\n0.00\nNet current assets/(liabilities)\nTotal assets less current liabilities\nTotal net assets / (liabilities)\n498 398.96\n498 398.96\n498 398.96\n465 135.71\n465 135.71\n465 135.71\nThe funds of the charity\nEndowment\nRestricted\nDesignated\nUnrestricted income funds\nThe funds of the charity\n0.00\n6,381.50\n463,693.54\n28 323.92\n498 398.96\n0.00\n6,381.50\n458, 656.90\n97.31\n465 135.71\nBishop's Stortford Baptist Church\nBalance Sheet detailed\nAs at\n31/1 2/2017\nAs at\n31/12/2016\nFixed assets\nOTHER: venous small fixed assets\nPASYSTEM: P A System for Worship\nTotal Fixed assets\nCurrent assets\nBU DEPOSIT: Baptist Union Dsposd Acc\nCA001: Bank Current Acc (Lloyds)\nCA003: Deposit Acc (Lloyds)\nCA005 Cash in Hand (Office)\nCA006: Cash in hand (Treasurer)\nCA013: Saffron BS Corp Tracker Bond\nCA014: Saffron BS Loyalty Corporate Account\nZ05: Accounts Receivable\nTotal Current assets\n310,594. 19\n9,663.71\n56,699.56\n101.42\n169.23\n38,032.23\n5,677.36\n77,461.26\n498,398.96\n309,395.72\n17,417.17\n43,088.94\n126.43\n226.78\n37,699.28\n5,666.03\n51,515.36\n465„135.71\nLiabilities\nZ04: Accounts Payable\nZ10: NCC Loan 5\nTotal Liabilities\nNet Asset surplus (deficit)\n498,398.96\n465,135.71\nReserves\nExcess /(deficit) to date\nZ01.
