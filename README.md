# unimodal-kie
This repository contains code accompanying our thesis "Generative Large Language Models for Unimodal Key Information Extraction."

## Installation
Just run
```poetry shell```
to install all necessary dependencies.

## Evaluation
You can re-evaluate our results with the corresponding jupyter notebooks. E.g. for Kleister Charity on the development set, you can use the `kleister_charity_dev_evaluation.ipynb` file. It will load predictions and logs to carry out the evaluation of a specific model, temperature, and shot setting. You can set these at the very top of the notebook.
